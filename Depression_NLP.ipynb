       " 'Mendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a major tool for the investigation of causal relationship among traits, utilizing results from large-scale genome-wide association studies. Bias due to horizontal pleiotropy, however, remains a major concern. We propose a novel approach for robust and efficient MR analysis using large number of genetic instruments, based on a novel spike-detection algorithm under a normal-mixture model for underlying effect-size distributions. Simulations show that the new method, MRMix, provides nearly unbiased or/and less biased estimates of causal effects compared to alternative methods and can achieve higher efficiency than comparably robust estimators. Application of MRMix to publicly available datasets leads to notable observations, including identification of causal effects of BMI and age-at-menarche on the risk of breast cancer; no causal effect of HDL and triglycerides on the risk of coronary artery disease; a strong detrimental effect of BMI on the risk of major depressive disorder.',\n",
       " \"The promise of personalized genomic medicine is that knowledge of a person's gene sequences and activity will facilitate more appropriate medical interventions, particularly drug prescriptions, to reduce the burden of disease. Early successes in oncology and pediatrics have affirmed the power of positive diagnosis and are mostly based on detection of one or a few mutations that drive the specific pathology. However, genetically more complex diseases require the development of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that have variable accuracy. The rarity of events often means that they have necessarily low precision: many called positives are actually not at risk, and only a fraction of cases are prevented by targeted therapy. In some situations, negative prediction may better define the population at low risk. Here, I review five conditions across a broad spectrum of chronic disease (opioid pain medication, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, major depression, and osteoporotic bone fracture), considering in each case how genetic prediction might be used to target drug prescription. This leads to a call for more research designed to evaluate genetic likelihood of response to therapy and a call for evaluation of PRS, not just in terms of sensitivity and specificity but also with respect to potential clinical efficacy.\",\n",

       " 'Recent and classical work has revealed biologically and medically significant subtypes in complex diseases and traits. However, relevant subtypes are often unknown, unmeasured, or actively debated, making automated statistical approaches to subtype definition valuable. We propose reverse GWAS (RGWAS) to identify and validate subtypes using genetics and multiple traits: while GWAS seeks the genetic basis of a given trait, RGWAS seeks to define trait subtypes with distinct genetic bases. Unlike existing approaches relying on off-the-shelf clustering methods, RGWAS uses a novel decomposition, MFMR, to model covariates, binary traits, and population structure. We use extensive simulations to show that modelling these features can be crucial for power and calibration. We validate RGWAS in practice by recovering a recently discovered stress subtype in major depression. We then show the utility of RGWAS by identifying three novel subtypes of metabolic traits. We biologically validate these metabolic subtypes with SNP-level tests and a novel polygenic test: the former recover known metabolic GxE SNPs; the latter suggests subtypes may explain substantial missing heritability. Crucially, statins, which are widely prescribed and theorized to increase diabetes risk, have opposing effects on blood glucose across metabolic subtypes, suggesting the subtypes have potential translational value.',\n",
       " \"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a circuit-oriented treatment for mental disorders. Unfortunately, even well-conducted psychiatric DBS clinical trials have yielded inconsistent symptom relief, in part because DBS' mechanism(s) of action are unclear. One clue to those mechanisms may lie in the efficacy of ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum (VCVS) DBS in both major depression (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). MDD and OCD both involve deficits in cognitive control. Cognitive control depends on prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions that project into the VCVS. Here, we show that VCVS DBS' effect is explained in part by enhancement of PFC-driven cognitive control. DBS improves human subjects' performance on a cognitive control task and increases theta (5-8Hz) oscillations in both medial and lateral PFC. The theta increase predicts subjects' clinical outcomes. Our results suggest a possible mechanistic approach to DBS therapy, based on tuning stimulation to optimize these neurophysiologic phenomena.\",\n",
       " 'Synaptic loss and deficits in functional connectivity are hypothesized to contribute to symptoms associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) can be used to index the number of nerve terminals, an indirect estimate of synaptic density. Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) with the SV2A radioligand [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J to examine synaptic density in n\\u2009=\\u200926 unmedicated individuals with MDD, PTSD, or comorbid MDD/PTSD. The severity of depressive symptoms was inversely correlated with SV2A density, and individuals with high levels of depression showing lower SV2A density compared to healthy controls (n\\u2009=\\u200921). SV2A density was also associated with aberrant network function, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functional connectivity. This is the first in vivo evidence linking lower synaptic density to network alterations and symptoms of depression. Our findings provide further incentive to evaluate interventions that restore synaptic connections to treat depression.',\n",

Studies have been shown that patients with DM are more susceptible to develop depression, when compared to the general population. The opposite also happens; MDD could be a risk factor for DM development. Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathophysiological mechanisms involved with these conditions, such as excess of glucocorticoids, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and inflammation. These processes can lead to an increase in damage to biomolecules and a decrease in antioxidant defense capacity, leading to oxidative stress.\",\n",

This question was examined in two samples of patients who were receiving individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression (Ns = 128 [Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression: STAR-D] and 183 [Continuation Phase Cognitive Therapy Relapse Prevention: C-CT-RP]). Logistic and linear regression and propensity score models were used to identify whether or not clinician assessments of homework adherence differentiated symptom reduction and remission, as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Reported Scale (QIDS-SR), and the QIDS-Clinician Scale (QIDS-C). CBT-related response and remission were equally likely between both high and low homework adherers in both studies and in all models. But in propensity adjusted models that adjusted for session attendance, for both the STAR-D and C-CT-RP samples, greater homework adherence was significantly associated with greater response and remission from depression in the first and last 8 sessions of CBT. Our results suggest that homework adherence can account for response and remission early and late in treatment, with adequate session attendence.',\n",
       " 'Depressed individuals are less reactive than healthy individuals to positive stimuli in the laboratory, but accumulating evidence suggests that they are more emotionally reactive to positive events in their daily lives. The present study probed the boundaries of this curious \"mood brightening\" effect and investigated its specificity to major depressive disorder (MDD) vis-à-vis generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), its closest boundary condition. We used ecological momentary assessment to measure reactions to positive events over one week in individuals with MDD (n = 38), GAD (n = 36), comorbid MDD-GAD (n = 38), and no psychopathology (n = 33). Depressed individuals responded to positive events with larger changes in affect, cognition, reported withdrawal (but not approach) behavior, and symptoms than healthy controls. More severe depression assessed before the sampling week predicted greater brightening. Altered reactivity to positive events was relatively specific to MDD when compared with GAD, similar to patterns found for other positive emotional processes. The robustness, scope, and relative specificity of the brightening effect highlights the need to resolve conflicting findings across laboratory and non-laboratory studies to advance understanding of altered reactivity in emotional disorders.',\n",

       " 'Electronic diary data, such as that acquired through Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), has historically provided novel insights into diverse psychological processes. Analyses of these data typically focus on modeling participant-specific means, variability, and stability. We propose a novel statistical framework to determine participant stability by quantifying fragmentation of standardized trajectories using the following 2-step approach: (1) participant-level EMA scores are normalized, and (2) normalized scores are dichotomized into 2 states, inside and outside a range of 1 standard deviation. Within-participant fragmentation measures were calculated from dichotomized scores and modeled with various covariates. We used this method to study patterns of emotional states and showed that the proposed fragmentation measures differentiate mood disorder subtypes, including Bipolar I (BPI), Bipolar II, and major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with unaffected controls. Fragmentation measures were regressed on the mood disorder subtype, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and mean squared successive difference. The analyses revealed decreased stability (more fragmentation) among those with BPI when inside the participant-specific standard range of attention (β = 0.09, p = .004) and decreased stability among those with MDD inside the standard range of mood (β = 0.04, p = .039) and attention (β = 0.05, p = .017). This work provides an illustration of the clinical significance of EMA in characterizing the stability of mood, attention, or other psychological states that may underlie psychological disorders and phenomena. The application of fragmentation provides a novel statistical approach that can characterize within-participant stability beyond currently available traditional approaches.

       " \"What drives the large differences across patients in terms of treatment efficacy of major depressive disorder (MDD) is unclear. A network approach to psychopathology may help to reveal underlying mechanisms determining patients' capacity for recovery. We used daily diary MDD symptom data and six-month follow-up data on depression to examine how dynamic associations between symptoms relate to the future course of MDD. Daily experiences of depressive symptoms of 69 participants were assessed by means of the SCL-90-R depression subscale, three days a week for a period of six weeks, as part of a larger intervention study. Multilevel vector autoregressive modelling was used to estimate networks of dynamic symptom connections. Long-term outcome was determined by the percentage change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score between pre-intervention and six-month follow-up. For patients with more persisting symptoms, the symptom 'feeling everything is an effort' most strongly predicted other symptoms. The networks of the two groups did not significantly differ in overall connectivity. Findings suggest that future research should not solely focus on the presence or intensity of individual symptoms when predicting long-term outcomes, but should also examine the role of a specific symptom in the larger network of dynamic symptom-to-symptom interactions.\",\n",

Results from the addressed area suggest that testing multiple markers together can provide a valuable outcome in concerning diagnosis, treatment selection and monitoring. Several influencing factors altering the levels of biomarkers as well as biologically inappropriate phenotypic measurements contribute to the numerous difficulties of precise evaluation and validation of biomarkers is.

Here, we assessed the differences in serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with MDD and BD. In total, we enrolled 21 MDD patients, 26 BD patients, and 20 healthy controls. We collected a total of 35 samples from BD patients in 3 different phases, depression phase, manic phase, and remission stage, and 27 samples from MDD patients in acute and remission phases. Serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels were assessed with solid phase sandwich ELISA-based quantitative arrays, and CRP levels were determined with an automatic analyzer. Both serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels were elevated in BD patients but not MDD patients. Subgroup analysis indicated elevated serum IL-6 in both the depression and manic phases in BD patients. The serum CRP levels did not change in either BD or MDD patients. However, sex differences in CRP concentrations were observed in healthy controls. Furthermore, there were linear correlations between the CRP levels and Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale (BRMS) scores in BD patients. IL-6 and IL-8 levels may serve as biomarkers to differentiate between MDD and BD patients, even when the clinical manifestations are atypical. IL-6 may be used for the differential diagnosis of MDD and depressive episodes in BD.',\n",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are independent (<i>r</i>² < 0.01) and are strongly related to minerals (<i>p</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) are selected as instrumental variables. Each standard deviation increase in magnesium (0.16 mmol/L) is associated with an 8.94-fold increase in the risk of RA (<i>p</i> = 0.044) and an 8.78-fold increase in BD (<i>p</i> = 0.040) but a 0.10 g/cm² increase in bone density related to OP (<i>p</i> = 0.014). Each per-unit increase in copper is associated with a 0.87-fold increase in the risk of AD (<i>p</i> = 0.050) and BD (<i>p</i> = 0.010). In addition, there is suggestive evidence that calcium is positively correlated (OR = 1.36, <i>p</i> = 0.030) and iron is negatively correlated with T2D risk (OR = 0.89, <i>p</i> = 0.010); both magnesium (OR = 0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.013) and iron (OR = 0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.047) are negatively correlated with gout risk. In the sensitivity analysis, causal estimation is not affected by pleiotropy. This study supports the long-standing hypothesis that magnesium supplementation can increase RA and BD risks and decrease OP risk and that copper intake can reduce AD and BD risks. This study will be helpful to address some controversial debates on the relationships between minerals and chronic diseases.\",\n",

       " 'Metabolic syndrome and major depression are two of the most common and debilitating disorders worldwide, occurring with significant rates of comorbidity. Recent studies have uncovered that each of these conditions is associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation. This is characterized by increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, altered leukocyte population frequencies in blood, accumulation of immune cells in tissues including the brain, and activation of these immune cells. Cytokines that become elevated during obesity can contribute to the progression of metabolic syndrome by directly causing insulin resistance. During chronic stress, there is evidence that these cytokines promote depression-like behavior by disrupting neurotransmitter synthesis and signal transduction. Animal models of obesity and depression have revealed a bi-directional relationship whereby high-fat feeding and chronic stress synergize and exacerbate metabolic dysregulation and behavioral abnormalities. Although far from conclusive, emerging evidence suggests that inflammation in the central and peripheral immune system may link metabolic syndrome to major depressive disorder. In this review, we will synthesize available data supporting this view and identify critical areas for future investigation.',\n",

An International Consortium on Hallucination Research working group, along with consumer groups, developed the 50-item QPE to assess the presence, severity, and phenomenology of hallucinations and delusions. Participants in the study who reported psychotic experiences included those with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder, and major depressive disorder, and those without a need for care (ie, nonclinical participants). There were 173 participants in total. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed. Reliability was examined in terms of stability, equivalence, and internal consistency. The data confirmed that the QPE had good psychometric properties and could be put forward as an accepted measure of the transdiagnostic evaluation of psychotic experiences. Further validation is recommended with neurological and medical populations. Given its validity and reliability, comprehensive evaluation of psychotic phenomena, and relatively quick administration time, we propose that the QPE is a valuable instrument for both clinical and research settings.',\n",

However, few studies have examined cytokine levels in an adolescent sample despite this being a common age of onset. <i>Methods</i>. We measured proinflammatory (IL-2, IFN-<i>γ</i>, IL-1<i>β</i>, TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-15) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-1Ra, and IL-10) cytokine serum levels in 22 adolescents with major depression and 18 healthy volunteers. Cytokines were measured by multiplex bead-based immunoassays at baseline, and 4 and 8 weeks after commencement of fluoxetine administration in the clinical group. <i>Results</i>. Compared to healthy volunteers, adolescents with major depression at baseline showed significant increases in all pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, except IL-1Ra and IL-10. Significant changes were observed in fluoxetine treatment compared to baseline: proinflammatory cytokines IFN-<i>γ</i>, IL-1<i>β</i>, TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-15 were decreased only at week 4 whereas IL-2 was increased only at week 8; anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 were increased at week 8 while IL-1Ra was reduced only at week 4.

There are several different hypotheses about the links between cognitive function and depression. For example, it has been argued that executive function deficits contribute to emotion regulation difficulties, which in turn increase risk for depression. Further, it has been suggested that some cognitive deficits, such as episodic memory, may reflect hippocampal abnormalities linked to both depression and episodic memory. We examined these questions in adolescents participating in a longitudinal study of preschool onset depression. We measured cognitive function at adolescence using the National Institutes of Health toolbox (vocabulary, processing speed, executive function, working memory and episodic memory), and examined relationships of cognitive deficits to depression, emotion regulation, life stress and adversity, as well as hippocampal volume trajectories over three imaging assessments starting at school age. Depression related deficits in episodic memory were found. Youths with either current and past depression showed episodic memory deficits even after controlling for other psychopathology and family income. Depression severity, emotion dysregulation, and life stress/adversity all predicted episodic memory impairment, as did smaller intercepts and slopes of hippocampal growth over time. Modest relationships of depression to hippocampal volume and strong relationships between emotion regulation and both episodic memory and hippocampal volume were found. These data are consistent with prior work in adults linking depression, episodic memory, emotion regulation, life stress/adversity, and hippocampal volume in adults and suggest similar relations are evident as early as adolescence when memory systems are under development.

       " 'The SMILES trial was the first intervention study to test dietary improvement as a treatment strategy for depression. Molendijk et al. propose that expectation bias and difficulties with blinding might account for the large effect size. While we acknowledge the issue of expectation bias in lifestyle intervention trials and indeed discuss this as a key limitation in our paper, we observed a strong correlation between dietary change and change in depression scores, which we argue is consistent with a causal effect and we believe unlikely to be an artefact of inadequate blinding. Since its publication, our results have been largely replicated and our recent economic evaluation of SMILES suggests that the benefits of our approach extend beyond depression. We argue that the SMILES trial should be considered an important, albeit preliminary, first step in the field of nutritional psychiatry research.',\n",
       " 'Theoretical frameworks emphasise associations between interpretations and responses to affect and bipolar disorder (BD). This review (PROSPERO CRD42016043801) investigated which emotion regulation (ER) strategies have been applied to BD, are elevated in BD compared to clinical and non-clinical controls, and are associated with clinical and functional outcomes in BD METHODS: Search terms relating to emotion regulation, coping and bipolar disorder were entered into Embase, MedLine and PsycInfo. Quantitative studies investigating relationships between ER strategies and BD were eligible for this narrative synthesis RESULTS: A large volume of research (n\\u202f=\\u202f47) investigated specific ER strategies in BD. Maladaptive strategies such as rumination and dampening were elevated in BD compared to controls and these particular strategies had a detrimental impact on outcomes such as mood symptoms. BD had a similar profile of ER strategies to unipolar depression, but there was limited comparison to other clinical groups. People with BD did not generally have deficits in using adaptive strategies, as evidenced by comparisons with controls and experimental studies LIMITATIONS: Methodological heterogeneity and a lack of ecologically valid ER assessments CONCLUSIONS: Empirical literature is critiqued in line with contemporary theories of BD and of emotion regulation more generally, in order to inform future research recommendations. This includes investigation of the importance of context in the impact of ER strategies, and discrepancies between trait and state use of ER strategies, particularly through experience sampling.',\n",

Despite the development of novel treatments for MDD, many patients present with treatment resistant depression (TRD), identified by treatment non-response following one or more adequate trials of an antidepressant. Rapastinel may prove to be a viable treatment for TRD; it has the potential to produce a rapid antidepressant response without serious adverse events and improve functional symptoms. Areas covered: We review the efficacy of rapastinel via completed and on-going clinical trials. The online databases Pubmed, clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu were searched for rapastinel (GLYX-13) treatment in subjects with MDD. Nine clinical trials were identified. Expert opinion: Rapastinel is a novel and potentially transformative treatment for individuals with TRD. There is a limited number of clinical studies so far, but this compound has the potential to provide rapid, reliable and robust antidepressant effects without psychotomimetic and other unwanted side effects. Alternative formulations such as the oral formulation, provide the opportunity for rapastinel to be administered less frequently, i.e. once weekly. Furthermore, the beneficial effects on measures of cognition and suicidality so far, represent a tremendous advantage.',\n",
       " 'The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis directly controls the stress response. Dysregulation of this neuroendocrine system is a common feature among psychiatric disorders. Steroid hormone receptors, like glucocorticoid receptor (GR), function as transcription factors of a diverse set of genes upon activation. This activity is regulated by molecular chaperone heterocomplexes. Much is known about the structure and function of these GR/heterocomplexes. There is strong evidence suggesting altered regulation of steroid receptor hormones by chaperones, particularly the 51 kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP51), may work with environmental factors to increase susceptibility to various psychiatric illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and anxiety. This review highlights the regulation of steroid receptor dynamics by the 90kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90)/cochaperone heterocomplexes with an in depth look at how the structural regulation and imbalances in cochaperones can cause functional effects on GR activity. Links between the stress response and circadian systems and the development of novel chaperone-targeting therapeutics are also discussed.',\n",

Identification of the genetics underpinning individual differences in response to negative events (stress-sensitivity) may improve our understanding of the molecular pathways involved, and its association with stress-related illnesses. We sought to generate a proxy for stress-sensitivity through modelling the interaction between SNP allele and MDD status on neuroticism score in order to identify genetic variants that contribute to the higher neuroticism seen in individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of depression compared to unaffected individuals. Meta-analysis of genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) in UK Biobank (N = 23,092) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (N = 7,155) identified no genome-wide significance SNP interactions. However, gene-based tests identified a genome-wide significant gene, ZNF366, a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptor function implicated in alcohol dependence (p = 1.48x10-7; Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold p < 2.79x10-6). Using summary statistics from the stress-sensitivity term of the GWIS, SNP heritability for stress-sensitivity was estimated at 5.0%. In models fitting polygenic risk scores of both MDD and neuroticism derived from independent GWAS, we show that polygenic risk scores derived from the UK Biobank stress-sensitivity GWIS significantly improved the prediction of MDD in Generation Scotland. This study may improve interpretation of larger genome-wide association studies of MDD and other stress-related illnesses, and the understanding of the etiological mechanisms underpinning stress-sensitivity.',\n",

This study aimed to investigate a possible association between leptin, adiponectin and dimensional measures of depressive symptoms in young adults with and without psychiatric illness. Total plasma adiponectin and leptin levels were measured in 194 young adults seeking psychiatric ambulatory care and 57 healthy controls. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Self-Rating Scale (MADRS-S). Analysis was performed on men and women separately. P-leptin levels were significantly elevated in patients compared with controls and correlated with total MADRS-S scores in the women. Women with P-leptin in the highest quartile reached a significantly higher MADRS-S score than women in the lowest quartile, but this difference disappeared after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and antidepressant use. MADRS-S score was associated with P-leptin in female patients without antidepressant use, independently of BMI. There was no association between P-leptin levels and current major depression. P-adiponectin levels were not associated with depressive symptoms or current major depression. The findings indicate that P-leptin levels are associated with depressive symptom severity in young women; however, the association is linked to other factors, which challenges its usefulness as a biomarker for depression in clinical psychiatry.',\n",

To compare pathophysiology in these disorders, we mapped brain serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor binding throughout prefrontal cortex and in anterior cingulate cortex postmortem. Cases and controls died suddenly minimizing agonal effects and had a postmortem interval ≤24\\u2009h to avoid compromised brain integrity. Neuropathology and toxicology confirmed absence of neuropathology and psychotropic medications. For most subjects (167 of 232), a DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis was made by psychological autopsy.

The anticholinergic agent scopolamine has also shown promise as a rapid-acting antidepressant. This study applied genome-wide markers to investigate the role of genetic variants in predicting acute antidepressant response to both agents. The ketamine-treated sample included 157 unrelated European subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). The scopolamine-treated sample comprised 37 unrelated European subjects diagnosed with either MDD or BD who had a current Major Depressive Episode (MDE), and had failed at least two adequate treatment trials for depression. Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) or the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scale scores at day 1 (24\\u2009h post-treatment) was considered the primary outcome. Here, we conduct pilot genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses to identify potential markers of ketamine response and dissociative side effects.

Findings require replication in larger samples in light of low power of analyses of these small samples. Neverthless, these data provide a promising illustration of our future potential to identify genetic variants underlying rapid treatment response in mood disorders and may ultimately guide individual patient treatment selection in the future.',\n",

Childhood trauma is a risk factor for developing MDD and is also associated with cognitive impairments in later life. We aimed to investigate the effects of childhood trauma on cognitive function in MDD. 68 medication-free MDD patients and 75 healthy controls (HC) participated. We tested cognitive function with the Autobiographical Memory Test, Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Trail Making Test A and B, Rey-Osterrieth/Taylor Complex Figure Test, and Digit Span Backward. Childhood trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Patients and HC did not differ with respect to age, sex, education. Mean CTQ sum scores differed significantly for depressed and HC with mean 47.8 (19.2) and 31.0 (6.8), respectively. Depressed patients and HC (without taking childhood trauma into account) differed only in AVLT performance. When childhood trauma was considered, this group difference disappeared. Subsequent regression analyses revealed that higher CTQ scores but not a diagnosis of MDD were associated with less specific autobiographical memories. Associations of CTQ with other cognitive domains failed significance after correction for multiple testing. Our results suggest that cognitive function is influenced by childhood trauma in MDD. However, the effects are small.',\n",

However, specific deficit patterns have not yet been reliably demonstrated. Tasks that employ emotionally ambiguous stimuli have recently shown distinct deficit patterns in patients with schizophrenia compared to other mental disorders as well as healthy controls. We here investigate whether a task which uses an ambiguous Japanese (Noh) mask and a corresponding human stimulus generates distinctive emotion attribution patterns in thirty-two Caucasian patients with schizophrenia, matched MDD patients and healthy controls. Results show that patients with schizophrenia displayed reaction time disadvantages compared to healthy controls while identifying sadness and anger. MDD patients were more likely to label stimuli with basic compared to subtle emotional expressions. Moreover, they showed more difficulties assigning emotions to the human stimulus than to the Noh mask. IQ, age and cognitive functioning did not modulate these results. Because overall group differences were not observed, this task is not suitable for diagnosing patients.

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. However, the causal relationship of risk factors, such as genetic predisposition or experience of augmented stress, remain unknown. Numerous studies in humans and rodents have implicated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in MDD pathology, as a genetic risk factor and a factor regulated by stress. Until now, the majority of preclinical studies have employed genetically modified mice as their model of choice. However, mice display a limited behavioural repertoire and lack expression of circulating BDNF, which is present in rats and humans. Therefore, heterozygous BDNF (BDNF<sup>+/-</sup> ) rats were tested for affective behaviours and accompanying expression of key genes associated with affective disorders in the brain. We found that BDNF<sup>+/-</sup> rats, which have reduced BDNF levels in brain and plasma, displayed symptoms of anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD, and anxiety-like behaviour, but no behavioural despair or cognitive impairments. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of genes that are implicated in modulation of the stress response and affective disorders. Hence, glucocorticoid receptor, neuregulin 1 and disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 gene expression were upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of BDFN<sup>+/-</sup> rats, whereas FK506 binding protein 5 levels were decreased in the hippocampus. We conclude that a reduction in BDNF levels alters expression of genes associated with affective disorders, which may contribute to the development of depressive-like symptoms.',\n",
       " 'An intensively researched and yet poorly understood phenomenon, both at clinical and neurobiological level, is the determinism of treatment-resistant depression. Even more controversial are the stages of approaching therapeutically this pathology because there are no evidence-based recommendations stating that a pharmacological agent is superior to another, on medium and long-term. Due to the lack of \"golden standard\" approaches, physician\\'s experience, therapeutic alliance and a close monitoring stand as the most useful good practices in the treatment of resistant depression. The neurobiology of this pathology is incompletely characterized, and the current paper will present data derived from single-photon emission computed tomography as arguments for a better understanding of the treatment-resistance in major depression. These data have been compared with the existing data in the literature and arguments in favor of using this investigational method have been formulated. All the three cases presented are patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant major depression, each case with its own psychiatric and somatic background, and therefore with its own therapeutic approach. In all these cases, structured interviews and psychometric scales were applied in order to allow a flexible pharmacological regimen, adjusted to the patient\\'s dynamic needs. Measurements for health-related quality of life were considered necessary for treatment-resistant depression monitoring because low values registered in this domain have important prognostic significance. Translational studies on animal models of depression support the existence of cerebral structural dysfunctions or lesions which can be correlated with clinical and neuroimaging data, allowing for the formulation of neurobiological and psychopharmacological models for treatment-resistant depression.',\n",

This study compares the cognition of MDD patients (N\\u202f=\\u202f65) and HCs (N\\u202f=\\u202f65), matched by one-to-one recruitment strategy for age, sex, and education (ages 19-60). The neuropsychological (NPS) performance was measured via an extensive NPS-test battery and analysed retrospectively, accounting for demographic and clinical variables. Full remission was defined as HAMD cut off ≤7, partial remission as HAMD 8-18. The findings show entire MDD group and partially remitted MDD with significantly poorer NPS performance compared to HCs, while remitted MDD patients did not differ significantly from HCs. This underscores how critical a clear definition of remission is to compare studies on MDD. The clinical variable \\'number of hospitalizations\\' had a significant effect on cognition, whereas current symptom severity did not correlate with performance on any cognitive domain. Higher number of hospitalizations may be associated with higher burden of illness and greater neurobiological \"scar effects\".',\n",

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by the altered integration of reward histories and reduced responding of the striatum. We have posited that this reduced striatal activation in MDD is due to tonically decreased stimulation of striatal dopamine synapses which results in decremented propagation of information along the cortico-striatal-pallido-thalamic (CSPT) spiral. In the present investigation, we tested predictions of this formulation by conducting concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) in depressed and control (CTL) participants. We scanned 16 depressed and 14 CTL participants with simultaneous fMRI and <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride PET. We estimated raclopride binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>), voxel-wise, and compared MDD and CTL samples with respect to BP<sub>ND</sub> in the striatum. Using striatal regions that showed significant between-group BP<sub>ND</sub> differences as seeds, we conducted whole-brain functional connectivity analysis using the fMRI data and identified brain regions in each group in which connectivity with striatal seed regions scaled linearly with BP<sub>ND</sub> from these regions. We observed increased BP<sub>ND</sub> in the ventral striatum, bilaterally, and in the right dorsal striatum in the depressed participants. Further, we found that as BP<sub>ND</sub> increased in both the left ventral striatum and right dorsal striatum in MDD, connectivity with the cortical targets of these regions (default-mode network and salience network, respectively) decreased. Deficits in stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors in MDD could account in part for the failure of transfer of information up the CSPT circuit in the pathophysiology of this disorder.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND This study was conducted to investigate the effects of low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on depression and cognition in patients with traumatic brain injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS To accomplish this, 13 patients who were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury were divided into an experimental group (n=7) and a control group (n=6). The experimental group received rTMS during a 30-minute session 5 days per week for 2 weeks; the control group received sham rTMS. The patients were then evaluated for depression using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and for cognitive function using the Trail Making Test (TMT) and the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT). RESULTS A significant decrease in MADRS, TMT, and SCWT was observed after the intervention in the experimental group (P<0.01), and there was a significant difference in the change value of MADRS, TMT, and SCWT compared to the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the effect size for gains in the experimental group and control group was very strong for MADRS, TMT, and SCWT (effect size=1.44, 1.49, and 1.24 respectively). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that application of low frequency rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with traumatic brain injury has a positive effect on depression and cognition.',\n",
       " 'We investigated the relationship between autonomic nervous system activity during each sleep stage and the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy control subjects. Thirty patients with MDD and thirty healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and body mass index completed standard overnight polysomnography. Depression severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Time- and frequency-domain, and fractal HRV parameters were derived from 5-min electrocardiogram segments during light sleep, deep sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and the pre- and post-sleep wake periods. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) alpha-1 values during REM sleep were significantly higher in patients with MDD than in control subjects, and a significant correlation existed between DFA alpha-1 and BDI score in all subjects. DFA alpha-1 was the strongest predictor for the BDI score, along with REM density as a covariate. This study found that compared with controls, patients with MDD show reduced complexity in heart rate during REM sleep, which may represent lower cardiovascular adaptability in these patients, and could lead to cardiac disease. Moreover, DFA alpha-1 values measured during REM sleep may be useful as an indicator for the diagnosis and monitoring of depression.',\n",

A total of 131 acutely ill MDD inpatients were enrolled to receive 20\\u202fmg of fluoxetine daily for 6 weeks. Eight WAIS-III subtests were administered at baseline. Symptom severity and functional impairment were assessed at baseline, and again at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Modified Work and Social Adjustment Scale (MWSAS), respectively. The generalized estimating equations method was used to analyze the influence of potential predictors over time on the HAMD-17 and MWSAS, after adjusting for covariates. Of the 131 participants, 104 (79.4%) who completed 8 WAIS-III subtests at baseline and had at least one post-baseline assessment were included in the analysis. Patients with lower forward digit span scores were more likely to have poor treatment outcomes, both measured by HAMD-17, and by MWSAS.

       " 'Reward dysfunction is often present in youth with major depressive disorder (MDD), but the specific neurobiological bases underlying reward valuation deficits remain unclear. The current study examined whether adolescents and young adults with MDD track brain and behavioral responses according to relative reward magnitude-a neurocognitive valuation process known as magnitude tracking. Female adolescents and young adults ages 15-20 years (n = 56 with current or past-year MDD; n = 26 healthy controls [HCs]) completed a task during functional neuroimaging in which they could win or lose money at high stakes (+$1/-50¢) and low stakes (+20¢/-10¢). Behaviorally, HC accelerated button press responses on high stakes compared to low-stakes trials, whereas MDD did not alter response speed across stakes. Neurally, HC increased recruitment of the ventral and dorsal striatum, canonical reward-processing regions, for high-magnitude versus low-magnitude rewards. However, the MDD group did not exhibit striatal magnitude tracking for low versus high rewards-an effect independent of MDD recency, MDD symptom severity, comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders, and psychiatric medication use. In contrast, striatal recruitment for overall reward reactivity, measured by comparing striatal activity for reward and loss feedback, was similar in the MDD and HC groups. However, reward reactivity was negatively correlated with current depression symptom severity in the MDD group. Taken together, these findings suggest that whereas reward reactivity may vary with current depression severity, reward magnitude tracking may represent an important aberrant valuation process in youth with depression-independent of symptom severity and recency. This valuation deficit may have implications for maladaptive motivation and learning observed in youth with MDD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).',\n",

       " \"Major depression is a complex disorder with no single, direct causal mechanism. Morbidity has been linked to genetic processes, developmental history, and unique environmental exposures. Epigenetic mechanisms, especially DNA methylation, are also likely important factors in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). A community-based twin sample has many advantages for epigenetic studies, given the shared genetic and developmental histories of same-sex twin pairs. This article describes the rationale and study design for the Mood and Methylation Study in which 133 twin pairs (101 monozygotic and 32 dizygotic), both discordant and concordant for lifetime history of MDD, were evaluated on a large number of variables related to MDD. The twins also provided blood samples for an epigenome-wide association study of differentially methylated regions (DMR) relevant to MDD. Although MDD is typically considered a disorder of the central nervous system, it is unfeasible to obtain a large sample of brain tissues. However, epigenetic variation is not limited to the affected tissue but can also be detected in peripheral blood leukocytes. Thus, this study focused on monocytes for the major analyses. Additional plans for the study include gene expression analysis from the same set of twins using RNA-seq and validation of significant DMRs in postmortem brain tissues from a separate sample. Moreover, sufficient samples have been collected to perform future 'multi-omic' analyses, including metabolome, microbiome, and transcriptome. Our long-term goal is to understand how epigenomic and other 'omic' factors can be manipulated for diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic purposes for MDD and its related conditions.\",\n",

Areas covered: This article covers the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vilazodone and provides an evaluation of the clinical usefulness of vilazodone for the treatment of MDD and anxiety disorders. A literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Expert opinion: Studies have shown that vilazodone is significantly superior to placebo. However, vilazodone cannot as yet be recommended as a first-line treatment option for MDD as it is unclear whether the drug's dual mechanism of action provides greater efficacy than prevailing treatment options. Moreover, more phase IV studies are needed to establish its efficacy and long-term safety in larger and more diverse populations. Although vilazodone may have an additional advantage for the treatment of anxiety symptoms in MDD, here also additional studies are required to confirm its efficacy over and above SSRI alternatives and other antidepressant treatments. Therefore, presently, vilazodone should be considered as a second- or third-line treatment option for MDD and GAD.\",\n",

Patients with depression show, for instance, disrupted neural emotion regulation in cognitive regulation regions such as lateral and medial prefrontal cortices. Since depressed individuals tend to attribute positive events to external circumstances and negative events to themselves, modifying this non-self-serving attributional style may represent a promising regulation strategy. Spontaneous causal attributions are generally processed in medial brain structures, particularly the precuneus. However, so far no study has investigated neural correlates of instructed causal attributions (e.g. instructing a person to intentionally relate positive events to the self) and their potential to regulate emotions. The current study therefore aimed to examine how instructed causal attributions of positive and negative events affect the emotional experience of depressed individuals as well as its neural bases. For this purpose pictures of sad and happy faces were presented to 26 patients with a lifetime major depression (MDD) and 26 healthy controls (HC) during fMRI. Participants should respond naturally (\"view\") or imagine that the person on the picture was sad/happy because of them (\"internal attribution\") or because something else happened (\"external attribution\"). Trait attributional style and depressive symptoms were assessed with questionnaires to examine potential influential factors on emotion regulation ability. Results revealed that patients compared to controls show a non-self-serving trait attributional style (i.e. more external attributions of positive events and more internal attributions of negative events). Intriguingly, when instructed to apply specific causal attributions during the emotion regulation task, patients and controls were similarly able to regulate positive and negative emotions. Regulating emotions through instructed attributions (internal/external attribution>view) generally engaged the precuneus, which was correlated with patients\\' trait attributional style (i.e. more precuneus activation during external>view was linked to a general tendency to relate positive events to external sources). Up-regulating happiness through internal (compared to external) attributions recruited the parahippocampal gyrus only in controls. The down-regulation of sadness (external>internal attribution), in contrast, engaged the superior frontal gyrus only in patients. Superior frontal gyrus activation thereby correlated with depression severity, which implies a greater need of cognitive resources for a successful regulation in more severely depressed. Patients and controls did not differ in activation in brain regions related to cognitive emotion regulation or attribution. However, results point to a disturbed processing of positive emotions in depression. Interestingly, increased precuneus resting-state connectivity with emotion regulation brain regions (inferior parietal lobule, middle frontal gyrus) was linked to healthier attributions (i.e. external attributions of negative events) in patients and controls. Adequate neural communication between these regions therefore seem to facilitate an adaptive trait attributional style. Findings of this study emphasize that despite patients\\' dysfunctional trait attributional style, explicitly applying causal attributions effectively regulates emotions. Future research should examine the efficacy of instructed attributions in reducing negative affect and anhedonia in depressed patients, for instance by means of attribution trainings during psychotherapy.',\n",

Herein we critically appraise evidence from both pre-clinical and clinical studies, focusing on putative mechanisms as well as clinical correlates and implications of the emergence tolerance during antidepressant treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). It is firstly unclear to what extent this phenotype reflects a pharmacological effect of an antidepressant, is driven by non-adherence, is a marker of latent bipolarity or another comorbidity, a marker of neuroprogression of the underlying disorder or the intrusion of the impact of psychosocial variables into the clinical course. The operational definitions of tolerance and its related phenomena have also been largely inconsistent. Several protective clinical indicators have been proposed, including a rapid-cycling course and comorbid chronic anxiety, whilst poor treatment adherence, proneness to emotional blunting and sub-threshold bipolarity have been identified as possible correlates of tolerance to antidepressant treatment in MDD. Putative neurobiological underpinnings include adaptations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the serotonergic system.

We used the Interpersonal-Reactivity-Index-questionnaire (IRI) for trait cognitive and emotional empathy and the Multifaceted-Empathy-Test (MET) for state cognitive and emotional empathy. Firstly, we found a main effect of alexithymia, irrespective of depression, on trait and state cognitive empathy: High alexithymia subjects showed lower scores in perspective taking (IRI) and in the cognitive-empathy-component of the MET. Secondly, we found main effects of alexithymia and depression on trait emotional empathy (IRI-subscale personal distress). Moreover, we found a significant depression-by-alexithymia-interaction on trait emotional empathy: MDD-patients showed particularly high personal distress when affected by alexithymia (IRI). Thirdly, alexithymia and depression had no impact on state emotional empathy (MET). However, analyzing positive and negative trials separately, we found more emotional empathy in MDD-patients concerning negatively valenced stimuli. Our data suggest dissociable and interacting effects of MDD and alexithymia on empathy. Importantly, except for heightened personal distress, empathy deficits in MDD-patients were entirely due to concurrent alexithymia.',\n",

The results show that a two-factor model (Model 2b; Krause et\\xa0al., 2010) provided the best fit. The model consist of two factors: somatic and non-somatic/affective symptoms. Somatic component includes sleep difficulties, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration difficulties, and psychomotor agitation/retardation while non-somatic/affective component covers anhedonia, depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death. Further, the results reveal a pattern where PHQ-15 somatic symptom-items have a higher significant relationship with MDD's somatic symptoms than with the MDD's non-somatic/affective symptoms.

To address these challenges, we developed an acute antidepressant placebo experiment involving the intravenous administration of a \"fast-acting antidepressant\" and a trial-by-trial sham fMRI \"neurofeedback\" manipulation, purporting to reveal mood-relevant neural responses. Twenty volunteers with major depression underwent this experiment while rating their expected and actual mood improvement. Mixed-effects analyses of trial-by-trial ratings revealed that the \"drug\" infusion cues induced higher expectancies of mood improvement, while both the \"drug\" infusion cue and the sham neurofeedback induced a reported mood improvement. Neurofeedback of greater magnitude, compared to lower magnitude, recruited the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). Individuals with greater lPFC responses to neurofeedback displayed: (1) greater effect of previous mood improvement on expectancy ratings and (2) greater effect of sham neurofeedback on mood improvement. Behavioral antidepressant placebo effects were additionally moderated by changes in peripheral β-endorphin plasma levels and depressive symptomatology. These data demonstrate the feasibility of trial-by-trial manipulation of antidepressant placebo-associated expectancies and their reinforcement.

The results show that Phox2a and Phox2b are normally expressed in the human locus coeruleus (LC) in adulthood. Furthermore, the levels of Phox2a protein and mRNA and protein levels of Phox2b were significantly elevated in the LC of brain donors that suffered from the major depressive disorder, as compared to age-matched and psychiatrically normal control donors. Fischer 344 rats subjected to chronic social defeat showed higher mRNA and protein levels of Phox2a and Phox2b in the LC, as compared to non-stressed control rats. In rats chronically administered oral corticosterone, mRNA and protein levels of Phox2b, but not Phox2a, in the LC were significantly increased. In addition, the corticosterone-induced increase in Phox2b protein was reversed by simultaneous treatment with either mifepristone or spironolactone. Exposing SH-SY5Y cells to corticosterone significantly increased expression of Phox2a and Phox2b, which was blocked by corticosteroid receptor antagonists. Taken together, these experiments reveal that Phox2 genes are expressed throughout the lifetime in the LC of humans and Fischer 344 rats.

The aim of this study was to test whether rs1799724, an SNP of TNF-α, contributes to the neuroanatomical changes in MDD. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 144 MDD patients and 111 healthy controls (HC) well matched for age, sex and education were recruited from Shanghai Mental Health Center. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) followed by graph theory based structural covariance analysis was applied to locate diagnosis\\u2009x\\u2009genotype interactions. Irrespective of diagnosis, individuals with the high-risk genotype (T-carriers) had reduced volume in left angular gyrus (main effect of genotype). Diagnosis\\u2009x\\u2009genotype interaction was exclusively localized to the visual cortex (right superior occipital gyrus). The same region also showed reduced volume in patients with MDD than HC (main effect of diagnosis), with this effect being most pronounced in patients carrying the high-risk genotype. However, neither global nor regional network of structural covariance was found to have group difference. In conclusion, a genetic variation which can increase TNF-α expression selectively affects the anatomy of the visual cortex among the depressed subjects, with no effect on the topographical organization of multiple cortical regions.

However, there is considerable variability in clinical outcomes, in previous studies and between patients. Because of high requirements for the use of fMRI based neuronavigation, many practitioners of rTMS still choose to use a standard 5 cm rule for rTMS coil placement which leads to large variations in which brain regions are being stimulated. We decided to test the possibilities of a MNI based MR‑less neuronavigation system in rTMS depression treatment, by comparing the physiological effects and clinical outcomes of 3 distinct stimulation targets. Forty‑six patients (thirty‑three female, thirteen male) from the Republican Vilnius psychiatric hospital, all with drug resistant depressive disorder, participated in the study. All patients received high frequency (10 Hz) stimulation for 10 to 15 daily rTMS sessions. However, before the treatment they were randomly sorted into 3 groups according to stimulation target in MNI map: Group 1 received rTMS at point ‑40; 48; 35; Group 2 received rTMS at point ‑46; 45; 38; Group 3 received rTMS at point ‑38; 44; 26. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and clinical tests were obtained the day before the rTMS course and after the last session. There were some notable differences in physiological changes between the groups, with the largest EEG band spectral power increases found in Group 1 patients and the lowest in Group 2 patients. There was a significantly larger decrease of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores in the Group 3 (66.94%) compared to Group 1 (57.52%) and Group 2 (56.02%). This suggests it is possible to achieve higher clinical efficacy and less physiological impact on the brain when using different targets in a neuronavigated MNI based MR‑less rTMS system.',\n",

       " 'Smoking and major depression frequently co-occur, at least in part due to shared genetic risk. However, the nature of the shared genetic basis is poorly understood. To detect genetic risk variants for comorbid nicotine dependence (ND) and major depression (MD), we conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two samples of African-American participants (Yale-Penn 1 and 2) using linear mixed model, followed by meta-analysis. 3724 nicotine-exposed subjects were analyzed: 2596 from Yale-Penn-1 and 1128 from Yale-Penn-2. Continuous measures (Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores and DSM-IV MD criteria) rather than disorder status were used to maximize the power of the GWAS. Genotypes were ascertained using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad array (Yale-Penn-1 sample) or the Illumina HumanCore Exome array (Yale-Penn-2 sample), followed by imputation based on the 1000 Genomes reference panel. An intronic variant at the GRIA4 locus, rs68081839, was significantly associated with ND-MD comorbidity (β\\u2009=\\u20090.69 [95% CI, 0.43-0.89], P\\u2009=\\u20091.53\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-8</sup>). GRIA4 encodes an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission and neuroplasticity. Conditional analyses revealed that the association was explained jointly by both traits. Enrichment analysis showed that the top risk genes and genes co-expressed with GRIA4 are enriched in cell adhesion, calcium ion binding, and synapses. They also have enriched expression in the brain and they have been implicated in the risk for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research is needed to determine the replicability of these findings and to identify the biological mechanisms through which genetic risk for each condition is conveyed.',\n",
       " 'So far, genetic studies of treatment response in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression have returned results with limited clinical utility. A gene × environment interplay has been proposed as a factor influencing not only pathophysiology but also the treatment response. Therefore, epigenetics has emerged as a major field of research to study the treatment of these three disorders. Among the epigenetic marks that can modify gene expression, DNA methylation is the best studied. We performed a systematic search (PubMed) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA guidelines for preclinical and clinical studies focused on genome-wide and gene-specific DNA methylation in the context of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and major depressive disorder. Out of the 112 studies initially identified, we selected 31 studies among them, with an emphasis on responses to the gold standard treatments in each disorder. Modulations of DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites have been documented for all classes of treatments (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants). The heterogeneity of the models and methodologies used complicate the interpretation of results. Although few studies in each disorder have assessed the potential of DNA methylation as biomarkers of treatment response, data support this hypothesis for antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants.',\n",

These machine learning models will allow us to learn associations between patient features and treatment response which have predictive value at the individual patient level; this learning can be optimized by selecting high-quality input features for the model. While current research is difficult to directly apply to the clinic, machine learning models built using knowledge gleaned from current research may become useful clinical tools.',\n",

       " 'Individuals in a major depressive episode often display impairment in cognitive control, and this impairment exists outside of the acute phase of illness. Impairment in cognitive control also has been associated with exposure to childhood adversity (CA). The current study examined whether exposure to CA can explain variance in a component of cognitive control-inhibitory control-independent of diagnostic status in young adults with and without a history of depression. Healthy control individuals (n\\xa0=\\xa040) and individuals with remitted major depressive disorder (n\\xa0=\\xa053) completed a task measuring inhibitory control, reported level of CA and completed a scanning session to assess gray matter volume and resting state connectivity in regions associated with cognitive control. The results demonstrate that higher levels of CA were associated with poorer inhibitory control, reduced right middle frontal gyrus gray matter, decreased connectivity of salience and emotion networks and increased connectivity in cognitive control networks, even after controlling for diagnostic status, residual depression symptoms and current stressors. Together, the results suggest that inhibitory control impairment and intrinsic connectivity changes may be characterized as developmental sequelae of early stress exposure.',\n",
       " 'The habenula is a small midbrain structure that is important for brain signaling and learning from negative events. Thus, the habenula is strongly connected to both the reward system and motor regions. Increasing evidence suggests a role for the habenula in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, including mood and substance use disorders. However, no studies to date have investigated habenular resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in suicide-related behaviors (SB). The authors enrolled 123 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder and a history of suicide-related behaviors (SB+), 74 individuals with MDD or bipolar disorder and a history of suicidal ideation but no history of SB (SB-), and 75 healthy control subjects (HC). A seed-based approach was used to identify regions showing different rsFC with the habenula followed by region of interest to region of interest post hoc comparisons. Compared with both the SB- and HC groups, the SB+ group showed higher connectivity between the left habenula and the left parahippocampal gyrus, the right amygdala, and the right precentral and postcentral gyri. Patients with mood disorders displayed higher rsFC between the left habenula and left middle temporal gyrus, the left angular gyrus, and the left posterior cingulate cortex, as well as lower rsFC between the right habenula and the left thalamus, when compared with HCs. These findings suggest that the habenula is involved in the neural circuitry of suicide. The higher habenular rsFC found in the SB+ group may mediate a dysfunction in the mechanism that links the habenula with motor activity and contextual associative processing.',\n",

       " \"Childhood emotional abuse impairs emotion regulation and increases risk for major depressive disorder in adulthood. Mounting evidence suggests that decreased resting-state high-frequency heart rate variability, an index of parasympathetic function, represents a transdiagnostic biomarker of emotion dysregulation. We propose that adults with histories of major depressive disorder and childhood emotional abuse represent a subpopulation at particularly high risk to exhibit deficits in parasympathetic control. The current report compared resting-state high-frequency heart rate variability across three groups: (1) depressed women who endorsed childhood emotional abuse (N\\u202f=\\u202f11); (2) depressed women without childhood emotional abuse (N\\u202f=\\u202f19), and (3) never-depressed women without childhood emotional abuse (N\\u202f=\\u202f22). Participants completed childhood trauma self-reports and assessment of resting-state high-frequency heart rate variability. ANCOVAs comparing the three groups after controlling for health-related, psychiatric, and respiratory factors were significant. Depressed women with childhood emotional abuse exhibited lower high-frequency heart rate variability than both groups without childhood emotional abuse (d's ranging from 0.81-0.92). Surprisingly, psychiatric factors were non-significant predictors, indicating that childhood emotional abuse may have a unique impact on autonomic functioning. Future research on larger samples is needed to disentangle the relative and synergistic burdens of depression and childhood trauma on physiologic indicators of emotion dysregulation.\",\n",
       " \"Regardless of categorical diagnosis, many psychiatric patients suffer from sudden attack of fear or intense anxiety. In this study, we defined anxiety attacks to refer to these phenomena and investigated their association with depression and suicide attempts. A total of 12,532 adults randomly selected population through the one-person-per-household method completed a face-to-face interview using the Korean version of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (K-CIDI). A total of 5.88% reported to have experienced anxiety attacks. Among them, 46.5% reported to have experienced anxiety attacks without life-threatening situations. 'Anxiety attacks' group reported more suicidal ideation, plan, and attempts, which were even higher frequencies in 'anxiety attacks without life-threatening situations' group than 'anxiety attacks only with life-threatening situations' group and showed stronger association with lifetime suicide attempts when it had comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) (AOR\\u202f=\\u202f9.69, 95%CI 5.90-15.90), compared with 'never' group. There was no association between each symptom of patients with anxiety attacks and their lifetime suicide attempt. In conclusion, the finding suggests that there are as many individuals who experience anxiety attacks without life-threatening situations as those with life-threatening situations. And anxiety attacks appear to be relevant to an increased risk of suicide attempt, especially without life-threatening situations and with comorbid MDD.\",\n",
       " 'Previous studies have reported dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Outpatients diagnosed with MDD (n\\u202f=\\u202f199) underwent psychological evaluation, and were followed up with a phone interview after 6 months, using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). At 6-month follow-up, 59 out of 199 patients with MDD were still depressed (29.5%), as shown by scores\\u202f≥\\u202f10 on the PHQ-9. The depressed group at follow-up showed significantly higher anxiety and suicidality levels at baseline than the non-depressed group at follow-up. Among the complete blood counts, lipid profiles, and hormone levels, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was the only parameter that was significantly increased in the still depressed group. Levels higher than 40\\xa0pg/mL of ACTH at baseline were associated with higher depression scores at follow-up. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that ACTH and cortisol predicted depression scores at follow-up, after controlling for baseline depression scores. Increased ACTH level at baseline may predict ongoing symptoms and severity of depression at follow-up, suggesting the role of dysfunctional HPA axis in MDD prognosis.',\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) had been associated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Studies had shown that patients with MDD were associated with lower BDNF protein levels, which could be reversed by antidepressant treatment. BDNF expression had also been affected by a number of microRNAs (miRNA). BDNF and miRNA in MDD had been investigated widely in the recent years, but the relationships between miRNAs and antidepressants were less studied. From November 2015 to October 2017, inpatients diagnosed with MDD were recruited. Serum miR-16, miR-30, miR-34, miR-128, miR-132, miR-134, miR-182, miR-183, miR-185, miR-212 levels were measured before and after four weeks of antidepressant treatment of either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Thirty-three patients with MDD were recruited. After treatment, miR-183 and miR-212 levels increased significantly. In patients treated with SSRI (n\\u202f=\\u202f13), miR-16 levels increased significantly after treatment. Therefore, miR-183 and miR-212 levels increased significantly after four weeks of antidepressant treatment. In the SSRI group, significantly increased miR-16 levels were found, but not in SNRI group, suggesting that different types of antidepressants might affect different sets of miRNAs.',\n",
       " 'Cognitive reserve may mitigate the degree of cognitive deficit observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), confounding attempts to fully characterize the nature of these deficits. In this study, cognitive reserve was examined as a potential moderator of neurocognitive deficits in MDD. Unmedicated, currently depressed patients with MDD (n\\u202f=\\u202f269), and healthy volunteers (n\\u202f=\\u202f143) were compared on measures assessing psychomotor speed, interference processing, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning. Moderating effects of education level and estimated intelligence level were examined as interactions, along with age, in a regression model for each test. Differences between patients and non-patients were found with most measures, and sustained in regression models as main effects. However, the interaction of estimated intelligence and patient status was significant for processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functioning, with patient/non-patient differences diminishing with higher estimated intelligence. Neither estimated intelligence nor education level impacted interference processing differences, which were reduced with increasing age. Better intellectual ability moderates the effect of MDD on neurocognitive test performance. This effect may confound attempts to characterize these deficits in higher functioning samples. More challenging tasks may be needed, given the potential predictive value of neurocognition for differential therapeutic and clinical outcomes.',\n",

We searched major electronic databases until January 2018 for systematic reviews with/without meta-analysis that investigated PA for any SMI. We rated the quality of studies with the AMSTAR tool, grading the quality of evidence, and identifying gaps, future research needs and clinical practice recommendations. For MDD, consistent evidence indicated that PA can improve depressive symptoms versus control conditions, with effects comparable to those of antidepressants and psychotherapy. PA can also improve cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in people with MDD, although the impact on physical health outcomes was limited. There were no differences in adverse events versus control conditions. For MDD, larger effect sizes were seen when PA was delivered at moderate-vigorous intensity and supervised by an exercise specialist. For schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, evidence indicates that aerobic PA can reduce psychiatric symptoms, improves cognition and various subdomains, cardiorespiratory fitness, whilst evidence for the impact on anthropometric measures was inconsistent. There was a paucity of studies investigating PA in bipolar disorder, precluding any definitive recommendations. No cost effectiveness analyses in any SMI condition were identified.

The current study investigated the role of a Gln transporter called sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter subtype 1/2 (SNAT 1/2), phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), and astrocytic glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) on CSDS animals exposed to cocaine. Before cocaine exposure, CSDS males already showed decreased levels of SNAT 1/2 in the NAc and prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to non-CSDS controls. The reduction in SNAT 1/2 levels was associated with an increase in Gln localization in the mitochondrial outer membrane in accumbal glutamatergic nerve terminals projecting from the PFC. CSDS females showed increased GLT-1 levels in the NAc and PFC compared to non-CSDS controls. Both acute and repeated cocaine exposure attenuated locomotor responses in CSDS males but increased those in CSDS females. Cocaine reduced SNAT 1/2 levels in the NAc but increased them in the PFC in CSDS males. Additionally, both PAG and GLT-1 levels were increased in the PFC in CSDS males. On the other hand, cocaine reduced SNAT 1/2 and GLT-1 levels in the NAc and PFC in CSDS females. Our results show that CSDS altered locomotor responses upon cocaine exposure in a sex-dependent manner that may be mediated by molecules associated with the Glu-Gln transfer.',\n",

Results across cohorts were combined via meta-analysis within a random effects model. Overall, PRS for MDD and neuroticism did not significantly predict antidepressant response but there was a consistent direction of effect, whereby greater genetic loading for both MDD (best MDD result, p < 5*10-5 MDD-PRS at 4 weeks, β = -0.019, S.E = 0.008, p = 0.01) and neuroticism (best neuroticism result, p < 0.1 neuroticism-PRS at 8 weeks, β = -0.017, S.E = 0.008, p = 0.03) were associated with less favourable response.

       " 'Functional connectivity is frequently derived from fMRI data to reduce a complex image of the brain to a graph, or \"functional connectome\". Often shortest-path algorithms are used to characterize and compare functional connectomes. Previous work on the identification and measurement of semi-metric (shortest circuitous) pathways in the functional connectome has discovered cross-sectional differences in major depressive disorder (MDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Alzheimer\\'s disease. However, while measurements of shortest path length have been analyzed in functional connectomes, less work has been done to investigate the composition of the pathways themselves, or whether the edges composing pathways differ between individuals. Developments in this area would help us understand how pathways might be organized in mental disorders, and if a consistent pattern can be found. Furthermore, studies in structural brain connectivity and other real-world graphs suggest that shortest pathways may not be as important in functional connectivity studies as previously assumed. In light of this, we present a novel measurement of the consistency of pathways across functional connectomes, and an algorithm for improvement by selecting the most frequently occurring \"normative pathways\" from the k shortest paths, instead of just the shortest path. We also look at this algorithm\\'s effect on various graph measurements, using randomized matrix simulations to support the efficacy of this method and demonstrate our algorithm on the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) of a group of 34 adolescent control participants. Additionally, a comparison of normative pathways is made with a group of 82 age-matched participants, diagnosed with MDD, and in doing so we find the normative pathways that are most disrupted. Our results, which are carried out with estimates of connectivity derived from correlation, partial correlation, and normalized mutual information connectomes, suggest disruption to the default mode, affective, and ventral attention networks. Normative pathways, especially with partial correlation, make greater use of critical anatomical pathways through the striatum, cingulum, and the cerebellum. In summary, MDD is characterized by a disruption of normative pathways of the ventral attention network, increases in alternative pathways in the frontoparietal network in MDD, and a mixture of both in the default mode network. Additionally, within- and between-groups findings depend on the estimate of connectivity.',\n",

High CRP-Glu group status was associated with greater severity of anhedonia and cognitive and motor slowing.

The 41-ROI network was further decomposed into four subnetworks. ReHo decreases within Subnetwork4-comprised of reward processing regions -was associated with anhedonia. Subnetwork4 ReHo also predicted decreased network integrity, which mediated the link between local ReHo and anhedonia in the Low but not High CRP-Glu group. These findings suggest that decreased ReHo and related disruptions in network integrity may reflect toxic effects of inflammation-induced increases in extrasynaptic glutamate signaling. Moreover, local BOLD oscillatory activity as reflected in ReHo might be a useful measure of target-engagement in the brain for treatment of inflammation-induced behaviors.\",\n",

We expected that depressed patients would show stable and elevated brain arousal relative to controls. Eighty-seven depressed patients and 36 healthy controls from four research sites in the United States were included in the analyses. The Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig (VIGALL) was used for the fully automatic classification of EEG-vigilance stages (indicating arousal states) of 1-second EEG segments; VIGALL-derived measures of brain arousal were calculated.

These studies suggest: (1) under certain conditions gamma rhythms can distinguish subjects with major depression from healthy controls, (2) gamma may distinguish bipolar disorder from unipolar depression, (3) various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that counteract depression also alter gamma, (4) animal models of depression-like behavior show gamma abnormalities, with changes in gamma associated with therapeutic recovery.

In addition, cognitive performance at follow-up and clinical characteristics (i.e., severity of disorder-related symptoms and number of hospitalizations between baseline and follow-up) are assessed. Multiple regression analysis results in a model with slow-wave sleep (SWS) and number of hospitalizations as significant predictors accounting for 50% (R2 = 0.507; p <0.001) of the variance in social functioning. SWS remains a significant predictor of long-term social functioning throughout a series of refining analyses which also identify baseline functioning as an additional significant predictor, whereas diagnosis is non-significant. Also, the effect of SWS on social functioning is not mediated by number of hospitalizations as assessed by a bootstrapped mediation analysis. We thus conclude that duration of slow-wave sleep is a powerful predictor of long-term social outcome in psychiatric disorders. Also, we discuss the relevance of verbal memory, symptom severity, and diagnostic category for social functioning. Future studies should test this finding by using a prospective design, a bigger sample, optimized predictor variables, and a more diverse set of diagnoses.

Participants in remission from major depression were randomized to an 8-week MBCT group (n = 46) or the ACC (n = 46). Outcomes were assessed at baseline; postintervention; and 6, 12, and 26 months. Intention-to-treat analyses indicated no differences between groups for any outcome over the 26-month follow-up. Time to relapse results (MBCT vs. ACC) indicated a hazard ratio = .82, 95% CI [.34, 1.99]. Relapse rates were 47.8% for MBCT and 50.0% for ACC. Piecewise analyses indicated that steeper declines in depressive symptoms in the MBCT vs. the ACC group from postintervention to 12 months were not maintained after 12 months. Both groups experienced a marginally significant rebound of depressive symptoms after 12 months but were still improved at 26 months compared to baseline (b = -4.12, p <= .008). Results for life satisfaction were similar. In sum, over a 26-month follow-up, MBCT was no more effective for preventing depression relapse/recurrence, reducing depressive symptoms, or improving life satisfaction than a rigorous ACC. Based on epidemiological data and evidence from prior depression prevention trials, we discuss the possibility that both MBCT and ACC confer equal therapeutic benefit. Future studies that include treatment as usual (TAU) control conditions are needed to confirm this possibility and to rule out the potential role of time-related effects. Overall findings underscore the importance of comparing MBCT to TAU as well as to ACCs.',\n",

Still, the specific psychological vulnerabilities of individuals with MDD-SAD are poorly understood. Individual attachment characteristics develop early in life through interactions with primary caregivers, and tend to persist throughout life. Early trauma can worsen attachment insecurity, increasing the risk for future anxiety and depression. The purpose of this study is to examine differences in individual attachment and history of trauma in depressed individuals with or without comorbid SAD and controls. One hundred sixty-two participants were categorized into three groups based on SCID-I interview: healthy controls (HC), individuals with current MDD without SAD (MDD), and individuals with current MDD comorbid with SAD (MDD-SAD). MDD-SAD group had significantly greater attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance compared to the MDD and HC groups. MDD-SAD group had greater clinician-rated depression severity and dysfunction compared to MDD group. In summary, the study further supports the clinical risks associated with MDD-SAD and suggests that insecure attachment might represent an associated vulnerability and a possible pathway which warrants further research and clinical attention.',\n",

       " 'DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that provides stability and diversity to the cellular phenotype. It is influenced by both genetic sequence variation and environmental factors, and can therefore potentially account for variation of heritable phenotypes and disorders. Therefore, methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) are promising complements to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of genetic variants. Of particular interest are methylation sites (CpGs) that are created or destroyed by the alleles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as these so-called CpG-SNPs may show variation in methylation levels on top of what can be explained by the sequence variation. Using sequencing-based data from 1132 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases and controls, we performed a MWAS of 970,414 common CpG-SNPs. The analysis identified 27 suggestively significant (P\\u2009<\\u20091.00\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-5</sup>) CpG-SNPs associations. Furthermore, the MWAS results were over-represented (odds ratios ranging 1.36-5.00; P ranging 4.9\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-3</sup>-8.1\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-2</sup>) among findings from three recent GWAS for MDD-related phenotypes. Overlapping loci included, e.g., ROBO2, ASIC2, and DCC. As the CpG-SNP analysis accounts for the number of alleles that creates CpGs, the methylation differences could not be explained by differences in allele frequencies. Thus, the results show that the MWAS and GWASs provide independent lines of evidence for the involvement of these loci in MDD. In conclusion, our methylation study of MDD contributes novel information about loci of relevance that complements previous findings and generates new hypothesis about MDD etiology, such as that the functional effects of genetic association may be partly mediated and/or enhanced by the methylation status in these loci.',\n",

This is the first meta-analysis to investigate how CYP2C19 polymorphisms predict citalopram/escitalopram efficacy and side effects. CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes comprise poor metabolizers (PM), intermediate and intermediate+ metabolizers (IM; IM+), extensive and extensive+ metabolizers (EM [wild type]; EM+) and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM) defined by the two most common CYP2C19 functional polymorphisms (rs4244285 and rs12248560) in Caucasians. These polymorphisms were genotyped or imputed from genome-wide data in four samples treated with citalopram or escitalopram (GENDEP, STAR*D, GenPod, PGRN-AMPS). Treatment efficacy was assessed by standardized percentage symptom improvement and by remission. Side effect data were available at weeks 2-4, 6 and 9 in three samples. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed using EM as the reference group. Analysis of 2558 patients for efficacy and 2037 patients for side effects showed that PMs had higher symptom improvement (SMD\\u202f=\\u202f0.43, CI\\u202f=\\u202f0.19-0.66) and higher remission rates (OR\\u202f=\\u202f1.55, CI\\u202f=\\u202f1.23-1.96) compared to EMs. At weeks 2-4, PMs showed higher risk of gastro-intestinal (OR\\u202f=\\u202f1.26, CI\\u202f=\\u202f1.08-1.47), neurological (OR\\u202f=\\u202f1.28, CI\\u202f=\\u202f1.07-1.53) and sexual side effects (OR\\u202f=\\u202f1.52, CI\\u202f=\\u202f1.23-1.87; week 6 values were similar). No difference was seen at week 9 or in total side effect burden. PMs did not have higher risk of dropout at week 4 compared to EMs. Antidepressant dose was not different among CYP2C19 groups. CYP2C19 polymorphisms may provide helpful information for guiding citalopram/escitalopram treatment, despite PMs being relatively rare among Caucasians (∼2%).',\n",

A k-means cluster analysis is applied to examine which types of God representations occur among depressed patients. Whether there is a relationship between the different God representations and suicide is examined by applying a linear regression analysis.<br/> RESULTS: Depressed patients uphold two types of God representation: a positive type (n=82) with positive feelings towards God and where God was experienced as supportive, and a negative type (n=73) with anger and anxiety towards God and where God was experienced as passive. Patients with a negative type of God representation scored significantly higher on suicidality. The severity of depression was the main predictor of suicidality, but God representations were also related with a 4% increase in the explained variance.<br/> CONCLUSION: In Christian patients with major depressive disorder a negative and a positive God representation emerged. Patients with a negative God representation mainly seem to feel abandoned by God. The suicidality is significantly increased in patients with a negative God representation, however, the increase in the proportion of the explained variance is small.',\n",

We examine how genetic risk for schizophrenia relates to adolescent psychosis-related and internalizing psychopathology using a latent modelling approach, and compare this to genetic risk for other psychiatric disorders, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the developmental pathways at this age. PRSs for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, neuroticism and bipolar disorder were generated for individuals in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the relationships of these PRSs with psychopathology factors modelled within (i) a correlated factors structure and (ii) a bifactor structure. The schizophrenia PRS was associated with an increase in factors describing psychotic experiences, negative dimension, depression and anxiety, but, when modelling a general psychopathology factor based on these measures, specific effects above this persisted only for the negative dimension. Similar factor relationships were observed for the neuroticism PRS, with a (weak) specific effect only for anxiety once modelling general psychopathology. Psychopathology during adolescence can be described by a general psychopathology construct that captures common variance as well as by specific constructs capturing remaining non-shared variance. Schizophrenia risk genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies mainly index negative rather than positive symptom psychopathology during adolescence. This has potentially important implications both for research and risk prediction in high-risk samples.',\n",

We explore the psychodynamic meaning of the hair pulling, both in light of the problems related to introjective and projective processes which, in the kleinian view, gives structure to the internal world and, according to Margaret Mahler, individuation-separation theory. The hypotheses on the significance of this symptom are discovered in part in light of the material which emerged from the patient's intermittent participation in group psychotherapy for nearly five years prior to her pregnancy. Her pregnancy represents the transformational process of this symptom. Her feelings of desperation and anguish, and the rather dramatic expression of them, accompanied by constant suicidal ideas, reveal other conflicts in her primary relationships. The contact with these relational issues is accompanied by a progressive resolution of the trichotillomania. This also comes through in the significantly symbolic shift from the pulling of her own hair to the pulling of the hair from her wig.\",\n",

Alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, especially of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function, are often observed in MDD, but evidence lacks for anxious depression. Childhood adversity is known to influence both the HPA axis and risk of MDD. Therefore, we investigated GR-function in anxious depression dependent on childhood adversity.

The results were compared with results from public microarray data. Seven differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MDD patients and controls were identified in our study and in the public microarray data: CD58, CXCL8, EGF, TARP, TNFSF4, ZNF583, and ZNF587. CXCL8 was among the top 10 downregulated genes in both studies. Eight genes related to SSRI responsiveness, including BTNL8, showed alterations in gene expression in MDD. The expression of the FCRL6 gene differed between SSRI responders and nonresponders and changed after SSRI treatment compared to baseline. In evaluating the response to mirtazapine, 21 DEGs were identified when comparing MDD patients and controls and responders and nonresponders.

       " 'The lack of biomarkers to identify target populations greatly limits the promise of precision medicine for major depressive disorder (MDD), a primary cause of ill health and disability. The endogenously produced molecule acetyl-l-carnitine (LAC) is critical for hippocampal function and several behavioral domains. In rodents with depressive-like traits, LAC levels are markedly decreased and signal abnormal hippocampal glutamatergic function and dendritic plasticity. LAC supplementation induces rapid and lasting antidepressant-like effects via epigenetic mechanisms of histone acetylation. This mechanistic model led us to evaluate LAC levels in humans. We found that LAC levels, and not those of free carnitine, were decreased in patients with MDD compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls in two independent study centers. Secondary exploratory analyses showed that the degree of LAC deficiency reflected both the severity and age of onset of MDD. Moreover, these analyses showed that the decrease in LAC was larger in patients with a history of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), among whom childhood trauma and, specifically, a history of emotional neglect and being female, predicted the decreased LAC. These findings suggest that LAC may serve as a candidate biomarker to help diagnose a clinical endophenotype of MDD characterized by decreased LAC, greater severity, and earlier onset as well as a history of childhood trauma in patients with TRD. Together with studies in rodents, these translational findings support further exploration of LAC as a therapeutic target that may help to define individualized treatments in biologically based depression subtype consistent with the spirit of precision medicine.',\n",

Previous reports proved the effectiveness of clonidine in treatment of withdrawal symptoms, but none have discussed cases with co-existing non-controlled psychiatric illness and prolonged duration of dexmedetomidine exposure. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 40-year-old woman diagnosed with viral meningitis. Due to her complicated psychiatric illness and viral meningitis, she developed severe agitation unresponsive to standard therapy. The patient had to be placed on dexmedetomidine, to which she developed dependence. There were several attempts to gradually withdraw dexmedetomidine but these were unsuccessful despite adding multiple antipsychotic medications. Withdrawal was manifested in multiple symptoms, including severe agitation, sweating, and tachycardia. Clonidine was used and was an effective treatment option to successfully withdraw the patient from dexmedetomidine. A smaller initial dose was used due to low baseline systolic blood pressure, which was successful. CONCLUSIONS This report proves that clonidine is an effective option for treatment of dexmedetomidine dependence compared to other antipsychotic agents. The present report is the first to discuss severe psychiatric illness and prolonged dexmedetomidine duration (>7 days) in a non-intubated patient. Dexmedetomidine withdrawal must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with psychiatric illness, which can be easily treated with clonidine.',\n",

Emerging research suggests that bipolar disorder is common among women with postpartum depression. Due to the lack of awareness of its existence, bipolar postpartum depression is often misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder, causing long delays for women to receive appropriate treatment.

This suggested approach could improve the outcome of postpartum depression and facilitate timely disorder-specific treatment interventions.',\n",
       " 'G72 has been characterised as a susceptibility gene that can have wide-ranging effects in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including schizophrenia and major depression. Indeed, its product, pLG72, is a potential serum biomarker for schizophrenia. Previous transcriptomic and biochemical studies have indicated that pLG72 may induce the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in cell damage. Here, we investigated the mechanism of pLG72 by transfecting a human U87 glioblastoma cell line with a G72 construct. By employing ROS-specific scavengers, we discovered that superoxide radicals were specifically induced in the pLG72-expressing cells. We also found that pLG72 interacted and co-localised with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), resulting in aggregation of SOD1 with a concomitant 23% or 74% reduction of total SOD activity, depending on the amount of G72 transfection plasmid. Finally, we found that transfection of U87 cells with the G72 construct caused a 29% decrease in cell proliferation. The observed loss of SOD1 function in pLG72-expressing cells may explain the elevated ROS levels and inhibition of U87 cell proliferation and has implications for understanding the onset of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.',\n",
       " 'Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) show between-group comorbidity and symptom overlap, and within-group heterogeneity. Resting state functional connectivity might provide an alternate, biologically informed means by which to stratify patients with GAD or MDD. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 23 adults with GAD, 21 adults with MDD, and 27 healthy adult control participants. We investigated whether within- or between-network connectivity indices from five resting state networks predicted scores on continuous measures of depression and anxiety. Successful predictors were used to stratify participants into two new groups. We examined whether this stratification predicted attentional bias towards threat and whether this varied between patients and controls. Depression scores were linked to elevated connectivity within a limbic network including the amygdala, hippocampus, VMPFC and subgenual ACC. Patients with GAD or MDD with high limbic connectivity showed poorer performance on an attention-to-threat task than patients with low limbic connectivity. No parallel effect was observed for control participants, resulting in an interaction of clinical status by resting state group. Our findings provide initial evidence for the external validity of stratification of MDD and GAD patients by functional connectivity markers. This stratification cuts across diagnostic boundaries and might valuably inform future intervention studies. Our findings also highlight that biomarkers of interest can have different cognitive correlates in individuals with versus without clinically significant symptomatology. This might reflect protective influences leading to resilience in some individuals but not others.',\n",
       " 'Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by insufficient top-down modulation of the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the amygdala-prefrontal interactions. We report the first controlled emotion self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG, <i>n</i>\\u202f=\\u202f20) learned to upregulate blood‑oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity of the left amygdala (LA) using the rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG, <i>n</i>\\u202f=\\u202f11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf. The study included three rtfMRI-nf training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously with fMRI. PTSD severity was assessed before and after the training using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). The EG participants who completed the study showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings, including significant reductions in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms. They also exhibited a significant reduction in comorbid depression severity. Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. No significant difference in the CAPS rating changes was observed between the groups. During the first rtfMRI-nf session, functional connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was progressively enhanced, and this enhancement significantly and positively correlated with the initial CAPS ratings. Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited a significant positive correlation with the initial CAPS. Reduction in PTSD severity between the first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated with enhancement in functional connectivity between the LA and the left DLPFC. Our results demonstrate that the rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity has the potential to correct the amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity deficiencies specific to PTSD.',\n",

       " 'Major depressive disorder topped ischemic heart disease as the number one cause of disability worldwide in 2012, and women have twice the risk of men. Further, the comorbidity of depression and cardiometabolic disorders will be one of the primary causes of disability worldwide by 2020, with women at twice the risk. Thus, understanding the sex-dependent comorbidities has public health consequences worldwide. We propose here that sex differences in MDD-cardiometabolic comorbidity originate, in part, from pathogenic processes initiated in fetal development that involve sex differences in shared pathophysiology between the brain, the vascular system, the CNS control of the heart and associated hormonal, immune, and metabolic physiology. Pathways implicate neurotrophic and angiogenic growth factors, gonadal hormone receptors, and neurotransmitters such as gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) on neuronal and vascular development of HPA axis regions, such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), in addition to blood pressure, in part through the renin-angiotensin system, and insulin and glucose metabolism. We show that the same prenatal exposures have consequences for sex differences across multiple organ systems that, in part, share common pathophysiology. Thus, we believe that applying a sex differences lens to understanding shared biologic substrates underlying these comorbidities will provide novel insights into the development of sex-dependent therapeutics. Further, taking a lifespan perspective beginning in fetal development provides the opportunity to target abnormalities early in the natural history of these disorders in a sex-dependent way.',\n",

Understanding the mechanisms through which genetic risk unfolds to influence these developmental outcomes is critical for developing prevention and intervention efforts, capturing key elements of Irv's research agenda and scientific legacy. In this study, we examined the role of parenting and personality in mediating the effect of genetic risk on adolescents' major depressive disorder and conduct disorder symptoms. Longitudinal data were drawn from a sample of 709 European American adolescents and their mothers from the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism. Results from multivariate path analysis indicated that adolescents' depressive symptoms genome-wide polygenic scores (DS_GPS) predicted lower parental knowledge, which in turn was associated with more subsequent major depressive disorder and conduct disorder symptoms. Adolescents' DS_GPS also had indirect effects on these outcomes via personality, with a mediating effect via agreeableness but not via other dimensions of personality. Findings revealed that the pattern of associations was similar across adolescent gender. Our findings emphasize the important role of evocative gene-environment correlation processes and intermediate phenotypes in the pathways of risk from genetic predispositions to complex adolescent outcomes.\",\n",

Methods Forty-seven pregnant women diagnosed with major depression were divided into two different treatment groups according to the severity of their depression. The first group was treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychological support. The second group (milder depression) was treated with psychological support only. The control group (CG) was made up of 26 healthy pregnant women. All of the patients and controls were assessed by means of a structured clinical interview and different self-reported questionnaires. Fetal ultrasonography assessments were performed in the second and third trimesters. Neonatal outcomes were evaluated at delivery. Results The infants of both treatment groups showed significant alterations in fetal biometry and a higher rate of low birth weight (LBW) with respect to controls. The infants of the patients treated with psychological support showed only a significantly higher rate of head circumference, <10th percentile with respect to controls. No significant difference was found between the two patient groups when fetal growth characteristics and neonatal outcomes were taken into account.

       " 'Lipid microdomains (\"rafts\") are dynamic, nanoscale regions of the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, that possess distinctive physicochemical properties including higher order than the surrounding membrane. Lipid microdomain integrity is thought to affect neurotransmitter signaling by regulating membrane-bound protein signaling. Among the proteins potentially affected are monoaminergic receptors and transporters. As dysfunction of monoaminergic neurotransmission is implicated in major depressive disorder and other neuropsychiatric conditions, interactions with lipid microdomains may be of clinical importance. This systematic review evaluates what is known about the molecular relationships of monoamine transporter and receptor regulation to lipid microdomains. The PubMed/MeSH database was searched for original studies published in English through August 2017 concerning relationships between lipid microdomains and serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transporters and receptors. Fifty-seven publications were identified and assessed. Strong evidence implicates lipid microdomains in the regulation of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters; serotonin 1A, 2A, 3A, and 7A receptors; and dopamine D1 and β2 adrenergic receptors. Results were conflicting or more complex regarding lipid microdomain associations with the dopamine transporter, D2, D3, and D5 receptors; and negative with respect to β1 adrenergic receptors. Indirect evidence suggests that antidepressants, lipid-lowering drugs, and polyunsaturated fatty acids may exert effects on depression and suicide by altering the lipid milieu, thereby affecting monoaminergic transporter and receptor signaling. The lipid composition of membrane subdomains is involved in localization and trafficking of specific monoaminergic receptors and transporters. Elucidating precise mechanisms whereby lipid microdomains modulate monoamine neurotransmission in clinical contexts can have critical implications for pharmacotherapeutic targeting.',\n",

       " \"Pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) typically involves a lengthy trial and error process to identify an effective intervention. This lengthy period prolongs suffering and worsens all-cause mortality, including from suicide, and is typically longer in late-life depression (LLD). Our group has recently demonstrated that during an open-label venlafaxine (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) trial, significant changes in functional resting state connectivity occurred following a single dose of treatment, which persisted until the end of the trial. In this work, we propose an analysis framework to translate these perturbations in functional networks into predictors of clinical remission. Participants with LLD (N\\u202f=\\u202f49) completed 12-weeks of treatment with venlafaxine and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and a day following a single dose of venlafaxine. Data was collected at rest as well as during an emotion reactivity task and an emotion regulation task. Remission was defined as a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ≤10 for two weeks. We computed eigenvector centrality (whole brain connectivity) and activation during the emotion regulation and emotion reactivity tasks. We employed principal components analysis, Tikhonov-regularized logistic classification, and least angle regression feature selection to predict remission by the end of the 12-week trial. We utilized ten-fold cross-validation and Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) curve analysis. To determine task-region pairs that significantly contributed to the algorithm's ability to predict remission, we used permutation testing. Using the fMRI data at both baseline and after the first dose of treatment yielded a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 68% (AUC\\u202f=\\u202f0.77), a 15% increase in accuracy over baseline MADRS. In general, the accuracy at baseline was further improved by using the change in activation following a single dose. Activation of the frontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus, caudate, thalamus, medial temporal cortex, middle cingulate, and visual cortex predicted treatment remission. Acute, dynamic trajectories of functional imaging metrics in response to a pharmacological intervention are a valuable tool for predicting treatment response in late-life depression and elucidating the mechanism of pharmacological therapies in the context of the brain's functional architecture.\",\n",
       " 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs originally involved in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. We have shown in previous work that the miRNA let-7b can act as a signalling molecule for Toll-like receptor 7, thereby initiating innate immune pathways and apoptosis in the central nervous system. Here, we investigated whether different members of the miRNA family let-7, abundantly expressed in the brain, are released into the human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whether quantitative differences in let-7 copies exist in neurodegenerative diseases. RNA isolated from CSF of patients with Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and from control patients with frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), major depressive episode (MDE) without clinical or neurobiological signs of AD, and healthy individuals, was reverse transcribed with primers against nine let-7 family members, and miRNAs were quantified and analyzed comparatively by quantitative PCR. let-7 miRNAs were present in CSF from patients with AD, FTLD, MDE, and healthy controls. However, the amount of individual let-7 miRNAs in the CSF varied substantially. CSF from AD patients contained higher amounts of let-7b and let-7e compared to healthy controls, while no differences were observed regarding the other let-7 miRNAs. No increase in let-7b and let-7e was detected in CSF from FTLD patients, while in CSF from MDE patients, let-7b and let-7e copy levels were elevated. In CSF from AD patients, let-7b and let-7e were associated with extracellular vesicles. let-7 family members present in the CSF mediated neurotoxicity in vitro, albeit to a variable extent. Taken together, neurotoxic let-7 miRNAs are differentially and specifically released in AD, but also in MDE patients. Thus, these miRNAs may mirror common neuropathological paths and by this serve to unscramble mechanisms of different neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

Resting state analyses were most robust for Cognitive control Network (positive) and Salience and Emotion Network (negative).

Given previous reports of disrupted reward processing in both AD and MDD, we hypothesized that rs10514299 would be associated with differences in striatal BOLD responses during reward/loss anticipation in AD. DNA samples from 45 recently detoxified patients with AD and 45 healthy controls (HC) were genotyped for rs10514299. Participants performed the Monetary Incentive Delay task in a 3-Tesla MRI scanner.

This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) with adiponectin and leptin in healthy middle-aged women (mean (SD) age, 45.6 (2.5) years). Cross-sectional analyses included 575 women with baseline adipokine data; longitudinal analyses included 262 women with 2-4 adipokine measurements over 5 years. The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was used to assess depressive symptoms; history of MDD was determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Adipokines were assayed from stored serum specimens; values were log-transformed for analyses. Linear and repeated measure random effects regression models evaluated associations of baseline CES-D scores with baseline adipokine concentrations and changes over time, respectively. Secondary analyses evaluated the relation of MDD history with adipokine concentrations. Mean (SD) baseline concentrations of adiponectin and leptin were 9.90 (4.92) μg/mL and 27.02 (20.06) ng/mL; both increased over time (p\\u202f<\\u202f.0001). CES-D scores were associated with lower adiponectin at baseline (per 1-SD: estimate=-0.04, SE=.02, p=.03) and over time (per 1-SD: estimate=-0.055, SE\\u202f=\\u202f.024, p=.02).

LD Score regression revealed a significant SNP-based heritability for both migraine (h<sup>2</sup>\\u2009=\\u200912%) and MDD (h<sup>2</sup>\\u2009=\\u200919%), and a significant cross-disorder genetic correlation (r<sub>G</sub>\\u2009=\\u20090.25; P\\u2009=\\u20090.04). Meta-analysis of results for 8,045,569 SNPs from a migraine GWAS (comprising 30,465 migraine cases and 143,147 control samples) and the top 10,000 SNPs from a MDD GWAS (comprising 75,607 MDD cases and 231,747 healthy controls), implicated three SNPs (rs146377178, rs672931, and rs11858956) with novel genome-wide significant association (P<sub>SNP</sub>\\u2009≤\\u20095\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-8</sup>) to migraine and MDD. Moreover, gene-based association analyses revealed significant enrichment of genes nominally associated (P<sub>gene-based</sub>\\u2009≤\\u20090.05) with both migraine and MDD (P<sub>binomial-test</sub>\\u2009=\\u20090.001). Combining results across migraine and MDD, two genes, ANKDD1B and KCNK5, produced Fisher's combined gene-based P values that surpassed the genome-wide significance threshold (P<sub>Fisher's-combined</sub>\\u2009≤\\u20093.6\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-6</sup>). Pathway analysis of genes with P<sub>Fisher's-combined</sub>\\u2009≤\\u20091\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-3</sup> suggested several pathways, foremost neural-related pathways of signalling and ion channel regulation, to be involved in migraine and MDD aetiology.

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness. However, there is currently no objective laboratory-based diagnostic tests for this disorder. Although, perturbations in multiple neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in MDD, the biochemical changes underlying the disorder remain unclear, and a comprehensive global evaluation of neurotransmitters in MDD has not yet been performed. Here, using a GC-MS coupled with LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics approach, we simultaneously quantified the levels of 19 plasma metabolites involved in GABAergic, catecholaminergic, and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems in 50 first-episode, antidepressant drug-naïve MDD subjects and 50 healthy controls to identify potential metabolite biomarkers for MDD (training set). Moreover, an independent sample cohort comprising 49 MDD patients, 30 bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (testing set) was further used to validate diagnostic generalizability and specificity of these candidate biomarkers. Among the 19 plasma neurotransmitter metabolites examined, nine were significantly changed in MDD subjects. These metabolites were mainly involved in GABAergic, catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems. The GABAergic and catecholaminergic had better diagnostic value than serotonergic pathway. A panel of four candidate plasma metabolite biomarkers (GABA, dopamine, tyramine, kynurenine) could distinguish MDD subjects from health controls with an AUC of 0.968 and 0.953 in the training and testing set, respectively. Furthermore, this panel distinguished MDD subjects from BD subjects with high accuracy. This study is the first to globally evaluate multiple neurotransmitters in MDD plasma. The altered plasma neurotransmitter metabolite profile has potential differential diagnostic value for MDD.',\n",

Peripheral metabolomic changes induced by OB and rTMS were monitored through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and ultrapressure liquid chromatography-driven targeted metabolomics evaluated with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). MI-rTMS and HI-rTMS attenuated psychomotor agitation but only MI-rTMS increased BDNF and neurogenesis levels. HI-rTMS normalized the plasma concentration of α-amino-n-butyric acid and 3-methylhistidine. IPA revealed significant changes in glutamine processing and glutamate signaling in the OB model and following MI-rTMS and HI-rTMS treatment. The present findings suggest that MI-rTMS and HI-rTMS induce differential neurobiologic changes in a mouse model of agitated depression. Further, α-amino-n-butyric acid and 3-methylhistidine may have utility as biomarkers to objectively monitor the response to rTMS treatment of depression.',\n",

While these methodologies appropriately address some critical questions on the potential of a drug, they either consider the past evidence without predicting the outcome of the future trials or focus only on efficacy, failing to account for the multifaceted aspects of a successful drug development. As quantitative benefit-risk assessments could enhance decision-making, we propose a more comprehensive approach using a composite definition of success based not only on the statistical significance of the treatment effect on the primary endpoint but also on its clinical relevance and on a favorable benefit-risk balance in the next pivotal studies. For one drug, we can thus study several development strategies before starting the pivotal trials by comparing their predictive probability of success. The predictions are based on the available evidence from the previous trials, to which new hypotheses on the future development could be added. The resulting predictive probability of composite success provides a useful summary to support the discussions of the decision-makers.

       " 'To date, there are no biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment response in clinical use. Such biomarkers could allow for individualized treatment selection, reducing time spent on ineffective treatments and the burden of MDD. In search of such a biomarker, multisite pretreatment and early-treatment (1 week into treatment) structural magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired from 184 patients with MDD randomized to an 8-week trial of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline or placebo. This study represents a large, multisite, placebo-controlled effort to examine the association between pretreatment differences or early-treatment changes in cortical thickness and treatment-specific outcomes. For standardization, a novel, robust site harmonization procedure was applied to structural measures in a priori regions (rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, lateral orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and hippocampus), chosen based on previously published reports. Pretreatment cortical thickness or volume did not significantly associate with SSRI response. Thickening of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the first week of treatment was associated with better 8-week responses to SSRI (p\\u2009=\\u20090.010). These findings indicate that frontal lobe structural alterations in the first week of treatment may be associated with long-term treatment efficacy. While these associational findings may help to elucidate the specific neural targets of SSRIs, the predictive accuracy of pretreatment or early-treatment structural alterations in classifying treatment remitters from nonremitters was limited to 63.9%. Therefore, in this large sample of adults with MDD, structural MR imaging measures were not found to be clinically translatable biomarkers of treatment response to SSRI or placebo.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, life-threatening, highly disabling disease. Standardized treatment with fewer adverse effects, quick onset, and long-term maintenance of the effects of brief treatment for MDD is always being pursued. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are highly expressed in the central nervous system and are involved in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether the overexpression and interference of 3 differentially down-regulated lncRNAs (NONHSAT142707, NONHSAG045500, and ENST00000517573) in MDD can affect the expression of central neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) transporter (SERT) in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, we synthesized and validated the effect of 3 lncRNA plasmids and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs); next, we transfected the plasmids and siRNAs that caused significant overexpression or interference in SK-N-SH cells, and tested the expression of SERT by qRT-PCR. RESULTS The results showed that 3 lncRNA plasmids and siRNAs2 caused overexpression and interference, respectively. Only the overexpression of NONHSAG045500 could significantly inhibit the expression of SERT; interference with NONHSAG045500 could significantly strengthen the expression of SERT. CONCLUSIONS This study indicated that the expression of SERT could be regulated by up-regulating or down-regulating NONHSAG045500 expression and suggested that NONHSAG045500 could potentially be established as a new therapeutic target of MDD. Future work may be needed to definitively determine the correlation between NONHSAG045500 and SERT in vivo.',\n",

       " 'An enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of depression would facilitate the discovery of new efficacious medications. To this end, we examined hippocampal transcriptional changes in rat models of disease and in humans to identify common disease signatures by using a new algorithm for signature-based clustering of expression profiles. The tool identified a transcriptomic signature comprising 70 probesets able to discriminate depression models from controls in both Flinders Sensitive Line and Learned Helplessness animals. To identify disease-relevant pathways, we constructed an expanded protein network based on signature gene products and performed functional annotation analysis. We applied the same workflow to transcriptomic profiles of depressed patients. Remarkably, a 171-probesets transcriptional signature which discriminated depressed from healthy subjects was identified. Rat and human signatures shared the SCARA5 gene, while the respective networks derived from protein-based significant interactions with signature genes contained 25 overlapping genes. The comparison between the most enriched pathways in the rat and human signature networks identified a highly significant overlap (p-value: 3.85\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>-6</sup>) of 67 terms including ErbB, neurotrophin, FGF, IGF, and VEGF signaling, immune responses and insulin and leptin signaling. In conclusion, this study allowed the identification of a hippocampal transcriptional signature of resilient or susceptible responses in rat MDD models which overlapped with gene expression alterations observed in depressed patients. These findings are consistent with a loss of hippocampal neural plasticity mediated by altered levels of growth factors and increased inflammatory responses causing metabolic impairments as crucial factors in the pathophysiology of MDD.',\n",

Inadequate management of missing data has been identified as a significant source of bias that can result in an overestimation of drug efficacy. Transparency related to the management of missing data is essential to assess the strength of evidence reported in publications. In a subset of 17 randomised clinical trials for two new antidepressant medications, we present a case study in which we examined investigators' decisions regarding how to handle missing data and if their chosen method took into account, possible violations of analytic requirements that could affect results. The majority of trials (76%) concluded that there was a benefit of antidepressant treatment and in 94% the methodology for handling missing data was identifiable. Of these, 50% imputed data using the last observation carried forward and half used a mixed-effects model repeated measure approach. Most reports did not provide a rationale for the method used, and no trials described analyses regarding differences between completers and dropouts. Sensitivity analysis was inconsistently reported and correction for multiple comparisons was not uniformly applied.

       " 'Psychiatric patients have a greater risk of premature mortality, predominantly due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Convincing evidence shows that psychiatric conditions are characterized by an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. This increased risk is present for a range of psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is some evidence for a dose-response association with the severity and duration of symptoms and for a bidirectional longitudinal impact between psychiatric disorders and MetS. Associations generally seem stronger with abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia dysregulations than with hypertension. Contributing mechanisms are an unhealthy lifestyle and a poor adherence to medical regimen, which are prevalent among psychiatric patients. Specific psychotropic medications have also shown a profound impact in increasing MetS dysregulations. Finally, pleiotropy in genetic vulnerability and pathophysiological mechanisms, such as those leading to the increased central and peripheral activation of immunometabolic or endocrine systems, plays a role in both MetS and psychiatric disorder development. The excess risk of MetS and its unfavorable somatic health consequences justifies a high priority for future research, prevention, close monitoring, and treatment to reduce MetS in the vulnerable psychiatric patient.',\n",

Findings underscore the important relationships between RVA and cortical development, suggesting two possible explanations: (i) in adolescent MDD, greater fronto-limbic thickness is compensatory for deficits in autonomic regulation or (ii) increased autonomic arousal results in delayed fronto-limbic maturation. Longitudinal research is necessary to further clarify the nature of the relationship between autonomic functioning and cortical development.\",\n",

Furthermore, orexins are known to play a role many of the phenotypes associated with stress-related mental illness such as changes in cognition, sleep-wake states, and appetite. Interestingly, orexins are altered in stress-related psychiatric disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorders. Thus, orexins may be a potential target for treatment of these disorders. In this review, we will focus on what is known about the role of orexins in acute and repeated stress, in stress-induced phenotypes relevant to psychiatric illness in preclinical models, and in stress-related psychiatric illness in humans. We will also briefly discuss how orexins may contribute to sex differences in the stress response and subsequent phenotypes relevant to mental health, as many stress-related psychiatric disorders are twice as prevalent in women.',\n",

An HB symptom questionnaire was given to twins via a telephone interview. Consistent with the literature of HB, the mean level of HB was significantly higher in females than in males. Maximum likelihood twin correlations for HB were 0.31 (95% CI [0.16, 0.45]) for MZM, 0.19 (95% CI [-0.05, 0.41]) for DZM, 0.50 (95% CI [0.41, 0.58]) for MZF, 0.28 (95% CI [0.11, 0.44]) for DZF, and 0.23 (95% CI [0.05, 0.40]) for OSDZ twins. These patterns of twin correlations suggested the presence of additive genetic influences on HB. Model-fitting analysis showed that additive genetic and individual-specific environmental influences on HB were 44% (95% CI [37, 51]) and 56% (95% CI [49, 63]), respectively. Shared environmental influences were not significant. These parameter estimates were not significantly different between two sexes, and did not change significantly with age in the present sample, suggesting that genetic and environmental influences on HB in both sexes are stable across adolescence and young adulthood.',\n",

In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of binge eating (BE) symptoms on suicidality and related clinical characteristics in major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 817 community participants with MDD were included. We compared two groups (with and without lifetime BE symptoms). The MDD with BE group was subdivided into a frequent BE (FBE) subgroup (BE symptoms greater than twice weekly) and any BE (ABE) subgroup (BE symptoms greater than twice weekly). The MDD with BE group comprised 142 (17.38%) patients. The FBE and ABE subgroups comprised 75 (9.18%) and 67 (8.20%) patients, respectively. Comorbid alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and history of suicide attempt were significantly more frequent in the MDD with BE group than MDD without BE group. Sexual trauma was also reported more frequently in MDD with BE group. No significant differences were observed between the ABE and FBE subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed an association of suicide attempt with BE symptoms and sexual trauma. Structural equation modeling showed that sexual trauma increased BE (β = 0.337, P <0.001) together with alcohol use (β = 0.185, P <0.001) and anxiety (β = 0.299, p<0.001), which in turn increased suicide attempt (β = 0.087, p = 0.011). BE symptoms were associated with suicide attempt in MDD after adjusting for other factors associated with suicidality. BE symptoms also moderated an association between suicide attempt and sexual trauma.',\n",
       " \"While existing research documents the impact of parental rejection on sexual minorities, the present study extends this research to include a subtler, yet potentially more pervasive, challenge facing sexual minorities and their parents, with lasting implications for mental health. Parental unfinished business refers to persistent, unresolved negative thoughts and feelings toward one's parents and is investigated here as a result of parental rejection of their sexual minority sons' sexual orientation. To capture developmental trajectories of parental unfinished business and its prospective predictors (i.e., rejection) and outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, social anxiety, alcohol abuse), young sexual minority men (<i>n</i> = 113; baseline <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 20.78) reported their experience of these constructs annually for 7 years. Results revealed significantly decreasing trajectories of unfinished business with mothers, but not fathers, over 7 years. Parental rejection of their son's sexual orientation prospectively predicted greater next-year unfinished business. Unfinished business with fathers prospectively predicted next-year depressive symptoms. Prospective effects did not extend to next-year social anxiety or alcohol abuse for unfinished business with either parent. This study positions unfinished business as a novel, distinct, and important component of young sexual minority men's identity development and depression and examines these constructs over seven formative years. Findings can inform theoretical accounts of sexual minority development and clinical case formulation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).\",\n",

We examined the abnormality in the regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in first-episode, drug-naive major depressive disorder (fMDD), and remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) and correlated these fluctuations with clinical markers of MDD. We conducted a retrospective study and reviewed the medical records of 43 patients with fMDD. Overall, 13 of the 43 patients who had at least 3 years of follow-up care and the 17-item Hamilton Depression rating scale less than 7 took no antidepressants for more than half a year at the end of the 3-year follow-up. We further chose a group of 14 healthy controls matched for age, sex and education level with patients with rMDD. Multiple comparison analysis was performed for ALFF and ReHo. The statistical significance level was set at P value of less than 0.05. We examined whether there were differences among the three groups in the whole-brain ALFF and ReHo during resting state. Compared with healthy controls, patients with fMDD showed significant decrease of ReHo in the right anterior lobe of cerebellum and significant increase of ReHo in the right inferior temporal gyrus, and significant decrease of ALFF in the left inferior parietal lobule and right caudate nucleus. Compared with patients with rMDD, those with fMDD showed significant increase of ReHo in the right fusiform gyrus and the left middle temporal gyrus, and significant increase of ALFF in the right superior temporal gyrus. Compared with healthy controls, patients with rMDD showed significant increase of ReHo in the right supramarginal and significant decrease of ReHo in the right precuneus, and significant decrease of ALFF in the right lingual gyrus and in the left superior frontal lobe. Only patients with fMDD showed the relatively robust increase in intrinsic activity of temporal gyrus. The temporal gyrus may play a critical role in depressive symptomatology. Abnormal right fusiform gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus alterations were present only in patients with rMDD but not in patients with fMDD, indicating that these alterations may be a therapeutic target for MDD. Abnormal right supramarginal, right precuneus, right lingual gyrus and left superior frontal lobe alterations were present only in patients with rMDD and not in healthy control, and thus may be used as a state marker of MDD.',\n",

A recent study using polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated based on the first-wave Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD meta-analysis (PGC-MDD1) suggests a modest shared genetic contribution to MDD and AD. Using a (~10 fold) larger discovery sample, we calculated PRS based on the second wave (PGC-MDD2) of results, in a severe AD case–control target sample. We found significant associations between AD disease status and MDD-PRS derived from both PGC-MDD2 (most informative P-threshold=1.0, P=0.00063, R2=0.533%) and PGC-MDD1 (P-threshold=0.2, P=0.00014, R2=0.663%) meta-analyses; the larger discovery sample did not yield additional predictive power. In contrast, calculating PRS in a MDD target sample yielded increased power when using PGC-MDD2 (P-threshold=1.0, P=0.000038, R2=1.34%) versus PGC-MDD1 (P-threshold=1.0, P=0.0013, R2=0.81%).

Meanwhile, in the subset of patients in which MDD was not the explicit exclusion criteria, PRS predicted more variance (n=999; P-threshold=1.0, P=0.0003, R2=0.693%).

A single ECT vs. sham session reduced neural response to unpleasant vs. pleasant pictures in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region showing greater response in the more depressed patients. This effect occurred in the absence of between-group differences in picture recall, mood symptoms or concomitant medication.

       " 'This work presents an automatically annotated fiber cluster (AAFC) method to enable identification of anatomically meaningful white matter structures from the whole brain tractography. The proposed method consists of 1) a study-specific whole brain white matter parcellation using a well-established data-driven groupwise fiber clustering pipeline to segment tractography into multiple fiber clusters, and 2) a novel cluster annotation method to automatically assign an anatomical tract annotation to each fiber cluster by employing cortical parcellation information across multiple subjects. The novelty of the AAFC method is that it leverages group-wise information about the fiber clusters, including their fiber geometry and cortical terminations, to compute a tract anatomical label for each cluster in an automated fashion. We demonstrate the proposed AAFC method in an application of investigating white matter abnormality in emotional processing and sensorimotor areas in major depressive disorder (MDD). Seven tracts of interest related to emotional processing and sensorimotor functions are automatically identified using the proposed AAFC method as well as a comparable method that uses a cortical parcellation alone. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method is more consistent in identifying the tracts across subjects and across hemispheres in terms of the number of fibers. In addition, we perform a between-group statistical analysis in 31 MDD patients and 62 healthy subjects on the identified tracts using our AAFC method. We find statistical differences in diffusion measures in local regions within a fiber tract (e.g. 4 fiber clusters within the identified left hemisphere cingulum bundle (consisting of 14 clusters) are significantly different between the two groups), suggesting the ability of our method in identifying potential abnormality specific to subdivisions of a white matter structure.',\n",

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an impairment of episodic memory, but the mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Animal models of MDD find impaired adult neurogenesis (AN) in the dentate gyrus (DG), and AN in DG has been suggested to play a critical role in reducing the interference between overlapping memories through pattern separation. Here, we study the effect of reduced AN in MDD on the accuracy of episodic memory using computational modeling. We focus on how memory is affected when periods with a normal rate of AN (asymptomatic states) alternate with periods with a low rate (depressive episodes), which has never been studied before. Also, unlike previous models of adult neurogenesis, which consider memories as static patterns, we model episodic memory as sequences of neural activity patterns. In our model, AN adds additional random components to the memory patterns, which results in the decorrelation of similar patterns. Consistent with previous studies, higher rates of AN lead to higher memory accuracy in our model, which implies that memories stored in the depressive state are impaired. Intriguingly, our model makes the novel prediction that memories stored in an earlier asymptomatic state are also impaired by a later depressive episode. This retrograde effect exacerbates with increased duration of the depressive episode. Finally, pattern separation at the sensory processing stage does not improve, but rather worsens, the accuracy of episodic memory retrieval, suggesting an explanation for why AN is found in brain areas serving memory rather than sensory function. In conclusion, while cognitive retrieval biases might contribute to episodic memory deficits in MDD, our model suggests a mechanistic explanation that affects all episodic memories, regardless of emotional relevance.',\n",

We also included data from a small yet completely independent cohort RIS-INT-93 as an external test dataset. We used features from enrollment and level 1 treatment (up to week 2 response only) of STAR*D to explore the feature space comprehensively and applied machine learning methods to model TRD outcome at level 2. For TRD defined using QIDS-C16 remission criteria, multiple machine learning models were internally cross-validated in the STAR*D training dataset and externally validated in both the STAR*D testing dataset and RIS-INT-93 independent dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70-0.78 and 0.72-0.77, respectively. The upper bound for the AUC achievable with the full set of features could be as high as 0.78 in the STAR*D testing dataset. Model developed using top 30 features identified using feature selection technique (k-means clustering followed by χ2 test) achieved an AUC of 0.77 in the STAR*D testing dataset. In addition, the model developed using overlapping features between STAR*D and RIS-INT-93, achieved an AUC of > 0.70 in both the STAR*D testing and RIS-INT-93 datasets. Among all the features explored in STAR*D and RIS-INT-93 datasets, the most important feature was early or initial treatment response or symptom severity at week 2.

       " \"There has been growing interest in studying attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood as a result of research indicating that ADHD often persists into adulthood and frequently is comorbid with other psychiatric disorders.

Explicating the factor structure of ADHD symptom measures is essential to determine if such self-report measures assess symptom dimensions showing distinctive relations with other psychopathology and psychosocial functioning. Consequently, we examined the structure of adult ADHD symptoms in a large sample of adult outpatients (N = 1,094). Symptoms were assessed via the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS; Kessler et al., 2005), which has become the most widely used self-report ADHD measure. Additionally, we extended prior research by examining the relations for emergent ADHD dimensions with other psychopathology and psychosocial impairment. Results indicated that the ASRS's items define a bifactor structure with specific dimensions of inattentiveness, motor hyperactivity/impulsivity, and verbal hyperactivity/impulsivity. Our results indicate that specific ADHD factors show distinctive relations in some ways. For example, verbal hyperactivity/impulsivity showed negative relations with major depressive disorder, whereas inattentiveness showed positive relations with major depression. These results highlight the need for future research determining the extent to which making distinctions among various ADHD symptom types (i.e., distinguishing motor and verbal hyperactivity/impulsivity) is empirically warranted and clinically useful.

       " \"Despite many interventions to promote medication adherence in older adults, we know little about how medication adherence has improved as a result of such interventions. The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term program impacts on medication adherence from participating in the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP). Secondary data used for this study included the CDSMP participants' sociodemographic characteristics and their baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments on health-related indicators, including medication adherence, self-rated health, depression, and patient communication skills. This study included those who were 65 years or older, had one or more chronic conditions, and attended at least the first or second session. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the impacts of short-term (6 months) changes in health-related indicators on long-term (12 months) changes in medication nonadherence. The subset analyses were performed among participants with self-rated major depression at baseline. This study included 687 participants. Self-reported medication adherence did not improve significantly at 6-month follow-up assessment but significantly improved at 12-month follow-up assessment. Among those with self-reported major depression at baseline assessment, the short-term improvements in depression and self-rated health were associated with long-term changes in medication adherence. The long-term impacts of the CDSMP on medication adherence were influenced by the short-term program impacts on health-related indicators. More targeted interventions are needed for patients with major depression, and programs such as the CDSMP can be particularly helpful among the population.\",\n",
       " 'Research has shown that therapeutic sleep deprivation (SD) has rapid antidepressant effects in the majority of depressed patients. Investigation of factors preceding and accompanying these effects may facilitate the identification of the underlying biological mechanisms. This exploratory study aimed to examine clinical and genetic factors predicting response to SD and determine the impact of SD on illness course. Mood during SD was also assessed via visual analogue scale. Depressed inpatients (n\\u2009=\\u200978) and healthy controls (n\\u2009=\\u200915) underwent ~36\\u2009h of SD. Response to SD was defined as a score of\\u2009≤\\u20092 on the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Global Improvement. Depressive symptom trajectories were evaluated for up to a month using self/expert ratings. Impact of genetic burden was calculated using polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder. In total, 72% of patients responded to SD. Responders and non-responders did not differ in baseline self/expert depression symptom ratings, but mood differed. Response was associated with lower age (p\\u2009=\\u20090.007) and later age at life-time disease onset (p\\u2009=\\u20090.003). Higher genetic burden of depression was observed in non-responders than healthy controls. Up to a month post SD, depressive symptoms decreased in both patients groups, but more in responders, in whom effects were sustained. The present findings suggest that re-examining SD with a greater focus on biological mechanisms will lead to better understanding of mechanisms of depression.',\n",

Irregularity of the sleep-wake rhythm, eveningness chronotype, abnormality of melatonin secretion, vulnerability of clock genes, and the irregularity of social time cues have also been well-documented in BD. Circadian rhythm dysfunction is prominent in BD compared with that in major depressive disorders, implying that circadian rhythm dysfunction is a trait marker of BD. In the clinical course of BD, the circadian rhythm dysfunctions may act as predictors for the first onset of BD and the relapse of mood episodes. Treatments focusing on sleep disturbances and circadian rhythm dysfunction in combination with pharmacological, psychosocial, and chronobiological treatments are believed to be useful for relapse prevention. Further studies are therefore warranted to clarify the relation between circadian rhythm dysfunction and the pathophysiology of BD to develop treatment strategies for achieving recovery in BD patients.',\n",

This may contribute to the lack of guidance on which antidepressant medications are best for suicidal depressed patients who present with high anxiety. This study explored whether anxiety predicts suicidal ideation in depressed individuals treated with paroxetine or bupropion. An 8-week double-blind trial comparing controlled-release paroxetine (N=36) versus extended-release bupropion (N=38) for effect on suicidal ideation and behavior in depressed patients with suicidal ideation, past attempt, or both found an advantage for paroxetine, but anxiety effects were not investigated. This secondary analysis explored the relationship, measured at baseline and weekly, of anxiety with suicidal ideation. Anxiety severity measured weekly correlated with suicidal ideation severity irrespective of treatment (P=0.012). Patients with high baseline anxiety showed a trend toward faster reduction of suicidal ideation with paroxetine compared with bupropion treatment (standard P=0.047; bootstrap P=0.077). The latter finding, if confirmed in larger samples, could enhance choice of antidepressant medication for suicidal, depressed patients presenting with high levels of anxiety.',\n",

This study examined the effect of feedback in combination with a CST in outpatient group psychotherapy. A prospective cohort study was performed with patients meeting diagnostic criteria for a major depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder. Patients received cognitive-behavioral group therapy or interpersonal group therapy and completed the Outcome Questionnaire-45 on a session by session basis. In the control cohort (N = 132), no feedback was provided. In the feedback cohort (N = 137), patients and clinicians received feedback on the treatment progress based on the Outcome Questionnaire-45. If a patient was deteriorating as compared with the start of treatment or the previous session, the CST was offered. Both cohorts showed a significant decrease in symptoms during therapy, but no significant differences existed on treatment outcome. The number of sessions was significantly lower in the feedback cohort. The results suggest that feedback in outpatient group psychotherapy does not improve outcomes but that fewer sessions may be sufficient to obtain outcomes similar to treatment as usual. More research with the use of progress feedback in outpatient group therapy is needed, especially with CSTs. (PsycINFO Database Record',\n",

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common condition that afflicts the general population across a broad spectrum of ages and social backgrounds. The inflammatory hypothesis of depression posits that immune hyperactivation and dysregulated cytokine production are involved in depression. To investigate cytokine profiles in patients with MDD, we examined the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and those of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in antidepressant drug-naïve patients with MDD. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had significantly higher levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α, but significantly lower levels of IL-8. There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-6 or TGF-β1. We found linear correlations between IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8, and the severity of depression, as well as between IL-8 and anxiety level in patients with comorbid anxiety disorder. In addition, higher IL-1β and TNF-α levels were associated with higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores, while higher IL-8 levels were associated with lower HAMD and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Here we present evidence of changes in cytokine levels in antidepressant drug-naïve patients with MDD. Abnormal expression of inflammatory cytokines in patients with depression suggests that depression activates an inflammatory process.

In this issue of Psychosomatic Medicine (2018;80:508-514), Patel et al. report data indicating that pre-existing hypertension may be inversely associated with the atypical but not typical form of depression. We highlight here the strengths and limitations of the article and discuss the findings in light of research linking blood pressure and emotion regulation. In general, evidence suggests that higher blood pressure is associated with reduced expression of negative emotions and pain. Two prominent models of interaction have been proposed and supported by epidemiological and experimental research: one assumes that elevations in blood pressure lead to reduced arousal and pain sensitivity through baroreceptor activation and possibly additional afferent mechanisms. Operant conditioning may then result in (chronic) hypertension. The other one posits that impaired emotion processing as indicated by dampened emotion recognition may lead to disinhibition of hypothalamic centers and thereby result in sustained increases in blood pressure. These models are described in context of the current literature and open research questions are formulated.',\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a globally prevalent psychiatric disorder that results from disruption of multiple neural circuits involved in emotional regulation. Although previous studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) found smaller values of fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter, predominantly in the frontal lobe, of patients with MDD, studies using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) are scarce. Here, we used DKI whole-brain analysis with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate the brain microstructural abnormalities in MDD. Twenty-six patients with MDD and 42 age- and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled. To investigate the microstructural pathology underlying the observations in DKI, a compartment model analysis was conducted focusing on the corpus callosum. In TBSS, the patients with MDD showed significantly smaller values of FA in the genu and frontal portion of the body of the corpus callosum. The patients also had smaller values of mean kurtosis (MK) and radial kurtosis (RK), but MK and RK abnormalities were distributed more widely compared with FA, predominantly in the frontal lobe but also in the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Within the callosum, the regions with smaller MK and RK were located more posteriorly than the region with smaller FA. Model analysis suggested significantly smaller values of intra-neurite signal fraction in the body of the callosum and greater fiber dispersion in the genu, which were compatible with the existing literature of white matter pathology in MDD. Our results show that DKI is capable of demonstrating microstructural alterations in the brains of patients with MDD that cannot be fully depicted by conventional DTI. Though the issues of model validation and parameter estimation still remain, it is suggested that diffusion MRI combined with a biophysical model is a promising approach for investigation of the pathophysiology of MDD.',\n",

This study examined the influence of emotional cues on PM performance in patients with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. All participants were required to respond to emotional or neutral PM cues while completing a working memory task. Healthy participants showed improved PM performance with positive and negative cues. Patients with major depressive disorder were not impaired in PM performance and showed significant improvement in PM performance when cued by negative but not positive cues. Patients with schizophrenia had impaired PM performance irrespective of cue emotionality. In addition, the majority of patients with schizophrenia failed to show an emotional enhancement effect, and only those who had normal arousal ratings for negative PM cues showed emotional enhancement effect. These findings show for the first time that patients with schizophrenia exhibit PM impairments even with emotional cues, and suggest that arousal may be a critical factor for schizophrenia patients to utilize emotional cues to facilitate execution of future actions. In patients with major depressive disorder, our findings suggest that the negative bias in attention and retrospective memory may also extend to memory for future actions.

Approximately one-quarter (26%) of all medication recommendations were jointly flagged by two or more DSTs as \"actionable\" but 19% of these recommendations provided conflicting advice (e.g., dosing) for the same medication.The level of disagreement in medication recommendations across the pharmacogenetic DSTs indicates that these tests cannot be assumed to be equivalent or interchangeable. Additional efforts to standardize genetic-based phenotyping and to develop medication guidelines are warranted.',\n",
       " \"Nicotine dependence and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly comorbid, yet causal links between these prevalent disorders are unclear. One possible mechanism is that nicotine ameliorates MDD-related neurobiological dysfunction in specific networks. For instance, cortico-striatal circuitry is enhanced by nicotine, and such paths are disrupted in individuals with MDD. Specifically, MDD has been associated with reduced connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) but enhanced connectivity between the dorsal striatum (DS) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Determining whether nicotine normalizes these circuits in non-smokers with MDD may elucidate mechanisms underlying links between disorders. This was tested by administering placebo and a 2-mg dose of nicotine to unmedicated non-smokers with and without MDD prior to collecting resting-state functional magnetic imaging data using a cross-over design. On placebo, individuals with MDD showed significantly reduced NAc-rACC and a trend for enhanced DS-DLPFC functional connectivity relative to healthy controls. In MDD, acute nicotine administration normalized both pathways to the level of healthy controls, while having no impact on healthy controls. Nicotine's effects on NAc-rACC connectivity was influenced by anhedonia, consistent with the role of this network in reward and nicotine's ability to enhance reward deficiencies in MDD. These results indicate that nicotine normalizes dysfunctional cortico-striatal communication in unmedicated non-smokers with MDD. Nicotine's influence on these circuitries highlights a possible mechanism whereby individuals with MDD are more vulnerable to develop nicotine dependence. Findings suggest that nicotinic agents may have therapeutic effects on disrupted cortico-striatal connectivity.\",\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder is a common but devastating mental disorder, and recent evidence shows that neuroinflammation may play a pivotal role in the etiology of depression. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) is an active component purifed from Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bge, which has shown anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. In this study, we explored whether AS-IV produced antidepressant effects via its inhibition of neuroinflammation in mouse models of depression. Depressive-like behaviors including decreased sucrose consumption, reduced locomotor activity and increased immobility time were induced in mice using repeated restraint stress (RRS). We found that administration of AS-IV (16, 32 and 64 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, ig) significantly attenuated RRS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, AS-IV administration significantly reduced the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, increased PPARγ expression and GSK3β phosphorylation, decreased NF-κB phosphorylation, and reduced NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containingprotein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and caspase-1 p20 generation in the hippocampus of the mice. LPS-induced depression-like behaviors were induced by LPS injection (1 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, ip), which were ameliorated by administration of AS-IV (20, 40 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, ig). The results of the LPS-induced mouse model were in accordance with those acquired from the RRS-induced mouse model: LPS injection significantly increased TNF-α and IL-1β expression in the mouse hippocampus, which was reversed by administration of AS-IV. Moreover, administration of AS-IV significantly increased PPARγ expression and GSK3β phosphorylation, and decreased NF-κB phosphorylation and NLRP3 inflammasome. These results suggest that AS-IV is a potential drug against depression, and its antidepressant effects are partially mediated by inhibition of neuroinflammation via the upregulation of PPARγ expression.',\n",

Clinicians have long cautioned that what may appear to be similar patient-reported symptoms may actually arise from different biological causes. With growing populations being diagnosed with different psychiatric conditions, it is critical for scientists and clinicians to develop precision medication tailored to individual conditions. Genome-wide association studies have highlighted the complicated nature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and autism spectrum disorder.

Conventional network analysis methods are hampered by differences in network size, density and normalization. Minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis has been recently suggested to ameliorate these limitations. Moreover, common MST analysis methods involve calculating quantifiable attributes and selecting these attributes as features in the classification. However, a disadvantage of these methods is that information about the topology of the network is not fully considered, limiting further improvement of classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel method combining brain region and subgraph features for classification, utilizing two feature types to quantify two properties of the network. We experimentally validated our proposed method using a major depressive disorder (MDD) patient dataset. The results indicated that MSTs of MDD patients were more similar to random networks and exhibited significant differences in certain regions involved in the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic (LCSPT) circuit, which is considered to be a major pathological circuit of depression. Moreover, we demonstrated that this novel classification method could effectively improve classification accuracy and provide better interpretability. Overall, the current study demonstrated that different forms of feature representation provide complementary information.',\n",
       " 'Depression is associated with alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. A proposed mechanism to explain these alterations are changes in DNA methylation levels, secondary to early life adversity (ELA), at stress-related genes. Two gene regions that have been implicated in the literature, the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) exon 1F and the FKBP5 gene intron 7 were examined in 67 individuals (33 depressed patients and 34 controls). We investigated whether cortisol concentrations, evaluated in 25 depressed patients and 20 controls, and measures of ELA were associated with the degree of methylation at these candidate gene regions. Mean NR3C1 exon 1F DNA methylation levels were significantly increased in the depressed cohort and the degree of methylation was found to be positively associated with morning cortisol concentrations. DNA methylation levels at specific CG sites within the NR3C1 exon 1F were related to childhood emotional abuse severity. DNA methylation at CG38 was related to both HPA axis and childhood emotional abuse measures in the depressed group. No FKBP5 differences were revealed. Our findings suggest that hypermethylation at the NR3C1 exon 1F may occur in depression. This locus-specific epigenetic change is associated with higher basal HPA axis activity, possibly reflecting acquired glucocorticoid receptor resistance.',\n",

We investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) to five facial expressions of basic emotion: fear, anger, disgust, sadness and happiness under both subliminal (masked) and conscious (unmasked) presentation conditions, and the source localization of group differences. In the conscious condition, controls showed a distinctly positive-going shift in responsive to negative versus happy faces, reflected in a greater positivity for the VPP frontally and the P300 parietally, and less negativity for the N200. By contrast, relatives showed less differentiation of emotions, reflected in less VPP and P300 positivity, particularly for anger and disgust, which produced an enhanced N200 for sadness. These group differences were consistently source localized to the anterior cingulate cortex. The findings contribute new evidence for neural disruptions underlying the differentiation of salient emotions in familial risk for depression. These disruptions occur to the appraisal (∼200\\u202fms post-stimulus) through to the context evaluation (∼300\\u202fms+ post-stimulus) phases of emotion processing, consistent with theories that risk for depression involves biased or attenuated processing of emotion.',\n",

Strengthening the mental ability to interfere with dysfunctional emotion processing may be beneficial in treating depression. According to models of emotion processing this may be done by successful down-regulation of enhanced amygdala activity. We investigated short periods of intentional emotion-introspection compared with cognitive self-reflection as two domains of self-awareness in terms of effects on emotion regulation. Thirty depressed patients performed twelve second periods of emotion-introspection, self-reflection and a neutral condition during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We analyzed brain activation in the patients with depression by means of whole brain, region of interest and connectivity analyses. Amygdala activity decreased during emotion-introspection relative to self-reflection and to the neutral condition, whereby left amygdala was inversely activated relative to the left insula. Insula activity itself was correlated with medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation. In conclusion, depressed patients are able to down-regulate amygdala activity by emotion-introspection.

       " 'The purpose of this study was to determine the specificity and reproducibility of CliniCom™ Psychiatric Assessment Software to appropriately diagnose five prevalent mental health disorders. This online assessment tool incorporates proprietary algorithms for its propensity assessment. Unlike other questionnaires, which require a survey per specific mental disorder, CliniCom can simultaneously assess multiple mental disorders for an individual. CliniCom was concordant with other commonly used assessment tools in diagnosing five prevalent disorders including: Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Social Phobia. The online tool was overall 78% concordant in diagnosing the same disorder during a test-retest analysis. When subjects exhibited two, three, or four disorders, the tool was less consistent in diagnosing the same set of disorders during the test-retest analysis (53% concordant). However, if evaluated as individual disorders within subjects, the more persistent disorders had a higher rate of concordance: MDD (83.3%), ADHD (81.0%), and OCD (68.4%). This study proposes CliniCom as an online assessment tool that demonstrates specificity in identifying specific psychiatric conditions and shows reproducibility over multiple administrations.',\n",
       " \"Imaging genetics studies involving participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) have expanded. Nevertheless, findings have been inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging genetics studies that enrolled MDD participants across major databases through June 30th, 2017. Sixty-five studies met eligibility criteria (N\\u202f=\\u202f4034 MDD participants and 3293 controls), and there was substantial between-study variability in the methodological quality of included studies. However, few replicated findings emerged from this literature with only 22 studies providing data for meta-analyses (882 participants with MDD and 616 controls). Total hippocampal volumes did not significantly vary in MDD participants or controls carrying either the BDNF Val66Met 'Met' (386 participants with MDD and 376 controls) or the 5-HTTLPR short 'S' (310 participants with MDD and 230 controls) risk alleles compared to non-carriers. Heterogeneity across studies was explored through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. Gender distribution, the use of medications, segmentation methods used to measure the hippocampus, and age emerged as potential sources of heterogeneity across studies that assessed the association of 5-HTTLPR short 'S' alleles and hippocampal volumes. Our data also suggest that the methodological quality of included studies, publication year, and the inclusion of brain volume as a covariate contributed to the heterogeneity of studies that assessed the association of the BDNF Val66Met 'Met' risk allele and hippocampal volumes. In exploratory voxel-wise meta-analyses, MDD participants carrying the 5-HTTLPR short 'S' allele had white matter microstructural abnormalities predominantly in the corpus callosum, while carriers of the BDNF Val66Met 'Met' allele had larger gray matter volumes and hyperactivation of the right middle frontal gyrus compared to non-carriers. In conclusion, few replicated findings emerged from imaging genetics studies that included participants with MDD. Nevertheless, we explored and identified specific sources of heterogeneity across studies, which could provide insights to enhance the reproducibility of this emerging field.\",\n",

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often accompanied by severe impairments in working memory (WM). Neuroimaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying these impairments have produced conflicting results. It remains unclear whether MDD patients show hyper- or hypoactivity in WM-related brain regions and how potential aberrations in WM processing may contribute to the characteristic dysregulation of cognition-emotion interactions implicated in the maintenance of the disorder. In order to shed light on these questions and to overcome limitations of previous studies, we applied a multivoxel pattern classification approach to investigate brain activity in large samples of MDD patients (N\\u2009=\\u200957) and matched healthy controls (N\\u2009=\\u200961) during a WM task that incorporated positive, negative, and neutral stimuli. Results showed that patients can be distinguished from healthy controls with good classification accuracy based on functional activation patterns. ROI analyses based on the classification weight maps showed that during WM, patients had higher activity in the left DLPFC and the dorsal ACC. Furthermore, regions of the default-mode network (DMN) were less deactivated in patients. As no performance differences were observed, we conclude that patients required more effort, indexed by more activity in WM-related regions, to successfully perform the task. This increased effort might be related to difficulties in suppressing task-irrelevant information reflected by reduced deactivation of regions within the DMN. Effects were most pronounced for negative and neutral stimuli, thus pointing toward important implications of aberrations in WM processes in cognition-emotion interactions in MDD.',\n",
       " 'The hypothalamus, a small diencephalic gray matter structure, is part of the limbic system. Volumetric changes of this structure occur in psychiatric diseases, therefore there is increasing interest in precise volumetry. Based on our detailed volumetry algorithm for 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we developed a method for 3 Tesla MRI, adopting anatomical landmarks and work in triplanar view. We overlaid T1-weighted MR images with gray matter-tissue probability maps to combine anatomical information with tissue class segmentation. Then, we outlined regions of interest (ROIs) that covered potential hypothalamus voxels. Within these ROIs, seed growing technique helped define the hypothalamic volume using gray matter probabilities from the tissue probability maps. This yielded a semi-automated method with short processing times of 20-40 min per hypothalamus. In the MRIs of ten subjects, reliabilities were determined as intraclass correlations (ICC) and volume overlaps in percent. Three raters achieved very good intra-rater reliabilities (ICC 0.82-0.97) and good inter-rater reliabilities (ICC 0.78 and 0.82). Overlaps of intra- and inter-rater runs were very good (≥ 89.7%).

Intermittent exercise training protocols, such as sprint interval training (SIT) have gained increasing popularity, but no studies on depressive symptoms following SIT in patients with MDD are available. Fifty-nine in-patients with MDD were randomly assigned to a SIT or CAT group. Medication was counterbalanced in both intervention arms. Both intervention groups received 3 weekly training sessions for 4-weeks (12 sessions in total). SIT comprised 25 bouts of 30 seconds at 80% of maximal power, whereas CAT consisted of 20 minutes of physical activity at 60% of maximal power. The training protocols were isocalorically designed. Maximal bicycle ergometer exercise testing yielded maximal and submaximal physical fitness parameters. The Beck-Depression-Inventory-II (BDI-II) was filled out by the patients before and after the intervention period. BDI-II scores substantially decreased in both groups with an effect size pointing towards a large effect (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001, η<sub>p</sub>²\\u202f=\\u202f0.70) while submaximal (0.07\\u202f<\\u202fd\\u202f<\\u202f0.89) and maximal (0.05\\u202f<\\u202fd\\u202f<\\u202f0.85) fitness variables improved in both groups.

Amygdala voxels had decreased functional connectivity (FC) with the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal lobe areas, including the temporal pole, inferior temporal gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus. The reductions in the strengths of the FC of the amygdala voxels with the medial orbitofrontal cortex and temporal lobe voxels were correlated with increases in the Beck Depression Inventory score and in the duration of illness measures of depression. Parcellation analysis in 350 healthy controls based on voxel-level FC showed that the basal division of the amygdala has high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and the dorsolateral amygdala has strong FC with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and related ventral parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. In depression, the basal amygdala division had especially reduced FC with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in reward; and the dorsolateral amygdala subdivision had relatively reduced FC with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in non-reward.',\n",

We conducted a literature search using the Medline, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, selecting English-language studies that included physiological measures compared by sex in addition to MDD. We identified 20 relevant studies, which consisted primarily of mixed methodology and samples. The reported physiological measures comprised a variety of serum biomarkers, gene mRNA expression, and brain activity. Findings suggest different biological patterns in those with MDD depending on sex. Specifically, women presented higher levels of inflammatory, neurotrophic, and serotonergic markers and a stronger correlation between levels of some inflammatory and neurotrophic factors and the severity of symptoms. This review provides information about possible different biological patterns for women and men with depressive disorder and may have important implications for treatment.

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study that included <sup>1</sup>H-MRS scans at baseline and at 24\\u2009h post ketamine and post-placebo infusions sought to determine glutamate levels in the pregenual anterior cingulate (pgACC) of 20 medication-free MDD subjects and 17 healthy volunteers (HVs) 24\\u2009h post ketamine administration, and to evaluate any other measured metabolite changes, correlates, or predictors of antidepressant response.

No significant between-group differences in <sup>1</sup>H-MRS-measured metabolites were observed at baseline. Antidepressant response was not predicted by baseline glutamate levels. Our results suggest that any infusion-induced increases in glutamate at the 24-h post ketamine time point were below the sensitivity of the current technique; that these increases may occur in different brain regions than the pgACC; or that subgroups of MDD subjects may exist that have a differential glutamate response to ketamine.',\n",

A total of 18 depressed individuals on MMT received DESV (50-100\\u2009mg/day) for 8 weeks. Participants were assessed for the following: (a) Safety of DESV using Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events-GI, ECG [corrected Q-T (QTc) interval measurement] and methadone serum levels; (b) depressive symptoms using Montgomery-Äsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); and (c) other outcomes including anxiety, suicidality, craving, substance use, quality of life, and other depression scales.

Z unit-weighted composite scores were computed as indices of nitro-oxidative stress driving lipid and protein oxidation. SOD1, LOOH, NOx, and uric acid were significantly higher and HDL and PON1 significantly lower in participants with GAD than in those without GAD. GAD was more adequately predicted by increased SOD + LOOH + NOx and lowered HDL + PON1 composite scores. Composite scores of nitro-oxidative stress coupled with aldehyde and AOPP production were significantly increased in participants with comorbid GAD + MDD as compared with all other study groups, namely MDD, GAD + BD, BD, GAD, and healthy controls. In conclusion, GAD is characterized by increased nitro-oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defenses, while increased uric acid levels in GAD may protect against aldehyde production and protein oxidation. This study suggests that increased nitro-oxidative stress and especially increased SOD1 activity, NO production, and lipid peroxidation as well as lowered HDL-cholesterol and PON1 activity could be novel drug targets for GAD especially when comorbid with MDD.',\n",

The FA and RD values in the prefrontal white matter tracts of patients with MDD were positively and negatively associated with COMT gene methylation, respectively. In the control group, on the other hand, the association between white matter connectivity and COMT gene methylation showed opposite pattern to those of MDD. COMT gene methylation has a substantial effect on the prefrontal connectivity in patients with MDD. Moreover, COMT gene methylation and prefrontal connectivity showed opposite relationships in patients and controls.

These molecules also produce efficacy against pain in multiple animal models. Additionally, co-morbid states of depression are prevalent among patients with pain and patients with anxiety. Compounds were shown to be selective for α2 and α3 constructs over α1 (except KRM-II-82), α4, α5, and α6 proteins in electrophysiological assays in transfected HEK-293T cells. Utilizing the forced-swim assay in mice that detects conventional and novel antidepressant drugs, we demonstrate for the first time that α2/3-selective PAMs are active in the forced-swim assay at anxiolytic-producing doses. In contrast, activity in a related model, the tail-suspension test, was not observed. Diazepam was not active in the forced-swim assay when given alone but produced an antidepressant-like effect in mice when given in conjunction with the α1-preferring antagonist, β-CCT, that attenuated the motor-impairing effects of diazepam. We conclude that these α2/3-selective PAMs deserve further scrutiny for their potential treatment of major depressive disorder. If effective, such a mechanism could add a beneficial antidepressant component to the anxiolytic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant spectrum of effects of these compounds.',\n",
       " 'There is an increasing amount of evidence which links the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with food IgG hyperreactivity. Some authors have suggested that food IgG hyperreactivity could be also involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of this study was to compare levels of serum IgG against 39 selected food antigens between three groups of participants: patients with MDD (MDD group), patients with IBS (IBS group) and healthy controls (HC group). The study included 65 participants (22 in the MDD group, 22 in the IBS group and 21 in the HC group). Serum IgG levels were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Medical records, clinical data and laboratory results were collected for the analysis. IgG food hyperreactivity (interpreted as an average of levels of IgG antibodies above 7.5 &micro;g/mL) was detected in 28 (43%) participants, including 14 (64%) from the MDD group, ten (46%) from the IBS group and four (19%) from the HC group. We found differences between extreme IgG levels in MDD versus HC groups and in IBS versus HC groups. Patients with MDD had significantly higher serum levels of total IgG antibodies and IgG against celery, garlic and gluten compared with healthy controls. The MDD group also had higher serum IgG levels against gluten compared with the IBS group. Our results suggest dissimilarity in immune responses against food proteins between the examined groups, with the highest immunoreactivity in the MDD group. Further studies are needed to repeat and confirm these results in bigger cohorts and also examine clinical utility of IgG-based elimination diet in patients with MDD and IBS.',\n",

       " 'Depression and panic disorder (PD) share the common pathophysiology from the perspectives of neurotransmitters. The relatively high comorbidity between depression and PD contributes to the substantial obstacles to differentiate from depression and PD, especially for the brain pathophysiology. There are significant differences in the diagnostic criteria between depression and PD. However, the paradox of similar pathophysiology and different diagnostic criteria in these two disorders were still the issues needing to be addressed. Therefore the clarification of potential difference in the field of neuroscience and pathophysiology between depression and PD can help the clinicians and scientists to understand more comprehensively about significant differences between depression and PD. The researchers should be curious about the underlying difference of pathophysiology beneath the significant distinction of clinical symptoms. In this review article, I tried to find some evidences for the differences between depression and PD, especially for neural markers revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The distinctions of structural and functional alterations in depression and PD are reviewed. From the structural perspectives, PD seems to have less severe gray matter alterations in frontal and temporal lobes than depression. The study of white matter microintegrity reveals more widespread alterations in fronto-limbic circuit of depression patients than PD patients, such as the uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiation. PD might have a more restrictive pattern of structural alterations when compared to depression. For the functional perspectives, the core site of depression pathophysiology is the anterior subnetwork of resting-state network, such as anterior cingulate cortex, which is not significantly altered in PD. A possibly emerging pattern of fronto-limbic distinction between depression and PD has been revealed by these explorative reports. The future trend for machine learning and pattern recognition might confirm the differentiation pattern between depression and PD based on the explorative results.',\n",
       " 'This multicenter study of the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression (GSRD) aimed to explore the association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and comorbid thyroid disease. A total number of 1410 patients` characteristics in terms of demographic and clinical information were compared between MDD subjects with and without concurrent thyroid disease using descriptive statistics, analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) and binary logistic regression analyses. We determined a point prevalence rate for comorbid hypothyroidism of 13.2% and 1.6% for comorbid hyperthyroidism respectively. Patients with MDD+comorbid hypothyroidism were significantly older, more likely to be female, inpatient and suffering from other comorbid chronic somatic conditions. Furthermore, MADRS score at onset of the current depressive episode was significantly higher, psychotic features of depression were more likely pronounced. Overall, patients in the MDD+comorbid hypothyroidism group were rather treated with a combination of drugs, for example, pregabalin, antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers. In the MDD+comorbid hyperthyroidism group patients were significantly older, of Caucasian origin and diagnosed with other somatic comorbidities. In conclusion, our analyses suggest that abnormal thyroid function, especially hypothyroidism, is linked to depression severity and associated with distinct psychopathologic features of depression. However, comorbid thyroid disease has no influence on treatment response. A combination or augmentation of psychopharmacological drugs, especially with antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and pregabalin is more likely in patients with hypothyroid conditions. Thyroid disorder is frequently found in combination with other chronic somatic diseases including hypertension and heart disease.',\n",
       " \"BACKGROUND Several genetic susceptibility loci for major depressive disorder (MDD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been described. Interactions among polymorphisms are thought to explain the differences between low- and high-risk groups. We tested for the contribution of interactions between multiple functional polymorphisms in the risk of MDD or AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS A genetic association case-control study was performed in 68 MDD cases, 84 AD cases (35 of them with comorbid depression), and 90 controls. The contribution of 7 polymorphisms from 5 genes (APOE, HSPA1A, SLC6A4, HTR2A, and BDNF) related to risk of MDD or AD development was analyzed. RESULTS Significant associations were found between MDD and interactions among polymorphisms in HSPA1A, SLC6A4, and BDNF or HSPA1A, BDNF, and APOE genes. For polymorphisms in the APOE gene in AD, significant differences were confirmed on the distributions of alleles and genotype rates compared to the control or MDD. Increased probability of comorbid depression was found in patients with AD who do not carry the ε4 allele of APOE. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of the interactions among polymorphisms of susceptibility loci in both MDD and AD confirmed a synergistic effect of genetic factors influencing inflammatory, serotonergic, and neurotrophic pathways at these heterogenous complex diseases. The effect of interactions was greater in MDD than in AD. A presence of the ε4 allele was confirmed as a genetic susceptibility factor in AD. Our findings indicate a role of APOE genotype in onset of comorbid depression in a subgroup of patients with AD who are not carriers of the APOE ε4 allele.\",\n",
       " 'Higher serotonin-1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) receptor binding potential (BP<sub>F</sub>) has been found in major depressive disorder (MDD) during and between major depressive episodes. We investigated whether higher 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding is a biologic trait transmitted to healthy high risk (HR) offspring of MDD probands. Data were collected contemporaneously from: nine HR, 30 depressed not-recently medicated (NRM) MDD, 18 remitted NRM MDD, 51 healthy volunteer (HV) subjects. Subjects underwent positron emission tomography (PET) using [<sup>11</sup>C]WAY100635 to quantify 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> BP<sub>F</sub>, estimated using metabolite, free fraction-corrected arterial input function and cerebellar white matter as reference region. Multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA) of PET data evaluated group status classification of individuals. When tested across 13 regions of interest, an effect of diagnosis is found on BP<sub>F</sub> which remains significant after correction for sex, age, injected mass and dose: HR have higher BP<sub>F</sub> than HV (84.3% higher in midbrain raphe, 40.8% higher in hippocampus, mean BP<sub>F</sub> across all 13 brain regions is 49.9%\\u202f±\\u202f11.8% higher). Voxel-level BP<sub>F</sub> maps distinguish HR vs. HV. Elevated 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> BP<sub>F</sub> appears to be a familially transmitted trait abnormality.

We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases and meta-analysis of randomized and nonrandomized trials comparing: 1) outcome to antidepressants and placebo between melancholic and non-melancholic depression; 2) outcome to different antidepressant classes in melancholic depression. Two outcomes were considered: clinical remission and response. Significant lower odds of remission to antidepressants in melancholic than in non-melancholic depressions were found. Although no significant differences were observed in the response to antidepressants between both subtypes of depression, those with melancholic features had lower odds of response to placebo. Finally, treatment of melancholic depression with serotonin reuptake inhibitors was associated with lower odds of remission compared with tricyclic antidepressants, and similar outcome compared with venlafaxine. Melancholia seems to show a differential pattern of outcome to antidepressants, which could be clinically valuable for a better implementation of personalized medicine of depression. Due to several limitations, further research is needed to support these preliminary findings.',\n",
       " '<i>Introduction</i>: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder. Currently, there is no objective, cost-effective and non-invasive method to measure biological markers related to the pathogenesis of MDD. Previous studies primarily focused on urinary metabolite markers which are not proximal to the pathogenesis of MDD. Herein, we compare urinary monoamines, steroid hormones and the derived ratios amongst MDD when compared to healthy controls. <i>Methods</i>: Morning urine samples of medicated patients suffering from MDD (<i>n</i> = 47) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 41) were collected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure five biomarkers: cortisol, dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and sulphate derivative of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS). The mean urinary levels and derived ratios of monoamines and steroid hormones were compared between patients and controls to identify potential biomarkers. The receiver operative characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of potential biomarkers. <i>Results</i>: Medicated patients with MDD showed significantly higher spot urine ratio of DHEAS/serotonin (1.56 vs. 1.19, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and lower ratio of serotonin/dopamine (599.71 vs. 888.60, <i>p</i> = 0.008) than healthy controls. A spot urine serotonin/dopamine ratio cut-off of >667.38 had a sensitivity of 73.2% and specificity of 51.1%. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our results suggest that spot urine serotonin/dopamine ratio can be used as an objective diagnostic method for adults with MDD.',\n",
       " \"Millions of people worldwide suffer from depression, but despite advances in pharmacological therapies, many patients do not experience symptomatic remission or treatment response, even after treatments with several medications. As such, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can not only predict the treatment response but also allow a rational selection of optimal therapy for each patient. Areas covered: This review examines the recent findings, coming from different 'omic sciences,' in human blood-based biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response with particular attention on genetic/epigenetic and biochemical biomarkers. Specific emphasis will be placed on key molecules related to neuroplasticity and inflammation because of their involvement in the pathophysiology of depression and antidepressant response. Expert commentary: Biomarker identification is still an ongoing work. Indeed, to date, no biomarkers have sufficiently proven specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility to be used in the clinical setting. However, 'omic' approaches hold great promise in identifying multiple features for predicting antidepressant response, making a personalized treatment strategy possible for each patient, and thereby assist with quick and efficacious responsiveness. It is thus necessary that future studies take an integrative approach that includes clinical assessment, environment influences, and molecular and biological biomarkers.\",\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by considerable morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.',\n",

However, documentation of its psychometric properties in military populations is limited, and there is no universally accepted cut-off score on the K10 to distinguish clinical vs. sub-clinical levels of distress. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the K10 in Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Data on 6700 Regular Forces personnel were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey. The internal consistency and factor structure of the K10 (range, 0-40) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal cut-offs for the K10, using the presence/absence of any of four past-month disorders as the outcome (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Cronbach's alpha (0.88) indicated a high level of internal consistency of the K10. Results from CFA indicated that a single-factor 10-item construct had an acceptable overall fit: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; 90% confidence interval (CI):0.05-0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.99, weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) = 2.06. K10 scores were strongly associated with both the presence and recency of all four measured disorders. The area under the ROC curve was 0.92, demonstrating excellent predictive value for past-30-day disorders. A K10 score of 10 or greater was optimal for screening purposes (sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 83%), while a score of 17 or greater (sensitivity = 53%; specificity = 97%) was optimal for prevalence estimation of clinically significant psychological distress, in that it resulted in equal numbers of false positives and false negatives. Our results suggest that K10 scale has satisfactory psychometric properties for use as a measure of non-specific psychological distress in the military population.\",\n",

Voxels in the PCC had significantly increased functional connectivity with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a region implicated in non-reward and which is thereby implicated in depression. In patients receiving medication, the functional connectivity between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and PCC was decreased back towards that in the controls. In the 350 controls, it was shown that the PCC has high functional connectivity with the parahippocampal regions which are involved in memory. The findings support the theory that the non-reward system in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex has increased effects on memory systems, which contribute to the rumination about sad memories and events in depression. These new findings provide evidence that a key target to ameliorate depression is the lateral orbitofrontal cortex.',\n",

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by biased information processing that leads to difficulties regulating negative affect, which includes difficulty decreasing negative affect as well as maladaptively increasing negative affect via cognitive processes. To examine the underlying neural correlates, we scanned depressed and never-depressed adults as they completed a cognitive reappraisal task which required decreasing negative affect while viewing a negative image (down-regulation) and increasing negative affect while viewing a neutral image (emotion generation). Compared to control participants, MDD participants had less recruitment of the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) during early phases of down-regulation, the latter associated with poorer negative affect regulation. Further, MDD participants exhibited greater recruitment of the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) during emotion generation, which was associated with lower negative affect. Dysregulated negative affect in MDD may be due to impairments in efficiently activating the dACC and SMA to meet regulation demands, and maladaptive generation of negative affect that characterizes individuals with MDD may be counteracted by compensatory activation in the MTG. Elucidating neural mechanisms that underlie the generation of negative affect in the absence of external stimuli is an important extension of previous work examining dysfunctional emotional processes in MDD.',\n",

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities have been described in both disorders and might play a role in the association between them. We aimed to study the role of HPA axis activity in the comorbidity between OCD and MDD, while controlling for psychopathological dimensions such as anxiety and depressive symptoms. We studied 324 participants belonging to four diagnostic groups: 1) MDD (n\\u202f=\\u202f101), 2) OCD with comorbid MDD (n\\u202f=\\u202f33), 3) OCD without MDD (n\\u202f=\\u202f52), and 4) healthy subjects (n\\u202f=\\u202f138).

       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a biased emotion perception. In the auditory domain, MDD patients have been shown to exhibit attenuated processing of positive emotions expressed by speech melody (prosody). So far, no neuroimaging studies examining the neural basis of altered processing of emotional prosody in MDD are available. In this study, we addressed this issue by examining the emotion bias in MDD during evaluation of happy, neutral, and angry prosodic stimuli on a five-point Likert scale during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As expected, MDD patients rated happy prosody less intense than healthy controls (HC). At neural level, stronger activation in the middle superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the amygdala was found in all participants when processing emotional as compared to neutral prosody. MDD patients exhibited an increased activation of the amygdala during processing prosody irrespective of valence while no significant differences between groups were found for the STG, indicating that altered processing of prosodic emotions in MDD occurs rather within the amygdala than in auditory areas. Concurring with the valence-specific behavioral effect of attenuated evaluation of positive prosodic stimuli, activation within the left amygdala of MDD patients correlated with ratings of happy, but not neutral or angry prosody. Our study provides first insights in the neural basis of reduced experience of positive information and an abnormally increased amygdala activity during prosody processing.',\n",

In medicine, placebo effects are a clear example of how expectancies activate opioid neurotransmission in a treatment context, leading to the experience of analgesia and the improvement of emotional states, among other symptoms. Molecular neuroimaging techniques using positron emission tomography (PET) and the selective μ-opioid receptor tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil have significantly contributed to our understanding of the neurobiological systems involved in the formation of placebo effects. This line of research has described neural and neurotransmitter networks implicated in placebo effects and provided the technical tools to examine inter-individual differences in the function of placebo responsive mechanisms. As a consequence, the capacity to activate endogenous opioid networks during the administration of placebos has been linked to the concept of resiliency mechanisms, partially determined by genetic factors, and uncovered by the cognitive emotional integration of the expectations created by the therapeutic environment and its maintenance through learning mechanisms. This evidence has contributed to the understanding of the biological bases of the cognitive and psychological mechanisms implicated in the response to treatments, and opened up new opportunities for drug development and the enhancement of treatment responses. Further, delineation of these processes within and across diseases is critical to understand neural systems that could be enhanced to promote symptomatic improvement and modify disease progression.',\n",
       " 'Accumulating evidence indicates that oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) pathways play a key role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, only a handful of studies have directly compared alterations in O&NS pathways among patients with MDD and BD types I (BPI) and BPII. Thus, the current study compared superoxide dismutase (SOD1), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), catalase, nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), malondialdehyde (MDA), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) between mood disorder patients in a clinically remitted state. To this end 45, 23, and 37 participants with BPI, BPII, and MDD, respectively, as well as 54 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Z-unit weighted composite scores were computed as indices of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nitro-oxidative stress driving lipid or protein oxidation. SOD1, NOx, and MDA were significantly higher in MDD than in the other three groups. AOPP was significantly higher in BPI than in HCs and BPII patients. BPII patients showed lower SOD1 compared to all other groups. Furthermore, MDD was characterized by increased indices of ROS and lipid hydroperoxide production compared to BPI and BPII groups. Indices of nitro-oxidative stress coupled with aldehyde production or protein oxidation were significantly different among the three patient groups (BDII > BDI > MDD). Finally, depressive symptom scores were significantly associated with higher LOOH and AOPP levels. In conclusion, depression is accompanied by increased ROS production, which is insufficiently dampened by catalase activity, thereby increasing nitro-oxidative damage to lipids and aldehyde production. Increased protein oxidation with formation of AOPP appeared to be hallmark of MDD and BPI. In addition, patients with BPII may have protection against the damaging effects of ROS including lipid peroxidation and aldehyde formation. This study suggests that biomarkers related to O&NS could aid in the differentiation of MDD, BPI, and BPII.',\n",

However, a potential role of LXRs in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) has never been investigated previously. Our present results demonstrated that levels of hippocampal LXRβ but not LXRα were down-regulated in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and were negatively correlated with the severity of CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, rats with LXRβ knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in hippocampus displayed depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis similar to those observed after CUS exposure. Conversely, LXRs activation by GW3965 (GW), a synthetic dual agonist for both LXRα and LXRβ isoforms, could improve depression-like behaviors and reverse the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in rats exposed to CUS. LXRβ knockdown by shRNA completely abrogated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of GW, suggesting that LXRβ isoform mediated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of the LXRα/β dual agonist. However, ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis with x-irradiation only partly but not completely abolished the antidepressant effects of GW in the behavioral tests, implying that the antidepressant effects mediated by LXRβ isoform are likely through both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent pathways.

Depressed patients show two major cognitive biases: excessive processing of negatively valenced emotional stimuli; and increased self-focus. Both of these biases help to facilitate the integration of negative self-related information in depressed patients and to maintain their negative mood. Brain imaging studies suggest that this cognitive impairment is characterized by abnormal cooperation between the cognitive and limbic networks involved in cognitive control and self-referential processing. In general, depression is a disorder of multiple networks with emotional, cognitive and emotional symptoms. Among these symptoms, cognition is a major determinant of functional and social outcomes.',\n",

       " 'Anxiety and other mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and seasonal affective disorder (SAD), affect nearly one-fifth of the global population and disproportionately affect young adults. Individuals affected by mood disorders are frequently plagued by sleep and circadian problems, and recent genetic studies provide ample support for the association of circadian and sleep syndromes with depression and anxiety. Mathematical modeling has been crucial in understanding some of the essential features of the mammalian circadian clock and is now a vital tool for dissecting how circadian genes regulate the molecular mechanisms that influence mood. Here, we model the effect of five clock gene polymorphisms, previously linked to mood disorders, on circadian gene expression and, ultimately, on the period length and amplitude of the clock, two parameters that dictate the phase, or alignment, of the clock relative to the environment. We then test whether these gene variants are associated with circadian phenotypes (Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness scores) and well-established measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) in a population of undergraduates ( n = 546). In this population, we find significant allelic and/or genotypic associations between CRY2 and two PER3 variants and diurnal preference. The PER3 length polymorphism (rs57875989) was significantly associated with depression in this sample, and individuals homozygous for the PER3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs228697) reported significantly higher anxiety. Our simple model satisfies available experimental knockdown conditions as well as existing data on clock polymorphisms associated with mood. In addition, our model enables us to predict circadian phenotypes (e.g., altered period length, amplitude) associated with mood disorders in order to identify critical effects of clock gene mutations on CRY/BMAL binding and to predict that the intronic SNPs studied represent gain-of-function mutations, causing increased transcription rate. Given the user-friendly structure of our model, we anticipate that it will be useful for further study of the relationships among clock polymorphisms, circadian misalignment, and mood disorders.',\n",

After 2\\u202fweeks' antidepressant treatment, the patients were subgrouped into responsive depression (RD, n\\u202f=\\u202f40) and non-responding depression (NRD, n\\u202f=\\u202f37) based on the reduction of Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD). The temporal variability of 90 brain nodes was calculated for further analysis. Compared with the HC group, both the RD and NRD subjects showed greater baseline temporal variability (i.e., greater dynamic) in the left inferior occipital gyrus. Significantly greater temporal variability in the left pallidum was found in the RD group than the NRD and the HC groups, and the higher variability of left pallidum correlated positively with the HAMD reduction. Moreover, the pooled MDD (i.e., RD and NRD) group showed greater baseline temporal variability in the right inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior occipital gyrus, the bilateral fusiform gyri and the left Heschl gyrus than the HC group. The distinctive pattern of dynamically reorganized networks may provide a crucial scaffold to facilitate early antidepressant response, and the temporal variability may serve as a promising indicator for the personalized therapy of MDD.\",\n",

In this study, we examined the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) of the rAI of 30 patients with BD, 30 patients with MDD, and 30 healthy controls. In the functional separation of rAI, the right dorsal AI (rdAI) and ventral AI (rvAI) were defined as seed regions. Sliding-window correlation of rAI subregions was implemented to measure the variance of dFC. BD and MDD shared abnormality in dFC, such as the decreased dFC between the rvAI and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Others were disorder-specific and included MDD-related increases in dFC between the rvAI and right precuneus, temporal pole, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This observation is in stark contrast to BD-related increases in the dFC between the rdAI and left inferior parietal lobule and right middle occipital gyrus. The abnormal dFC of rAI shared by BD and MDD supports the importance of rAI in the common pathophysiology of these disorders. Meanwhile, disorder-specific abnormalities that attribute to the dorsal and ventral divisions of rAI can be used as biomarkers to differentiate BD from MDD.',\n",

One can ask: which of these is common for MDD and SCH. In our review of the latest neuroscientific studies, we show that MDD and SCH do not share consummatory anhedonia, as SCH patients usually have unaltered liking. Therefore, we investigated whether motivational anhedonia is the common symptom across MDD and SCH. With regard to the similarities and differences between the neural mechanisms of MDD and SCH, here we expand the current knowledge of motivation deficits and present the common underlying mechanism of motivational anhedonia - the dopamine dysregulation hypothesis - stating that any prolonged dysregulation in tonic dopamine signaling that exceeds the given equilibrium can lead to striatal dysfunction and motivational anhedonia.

       " 'Loneliness is a heritable trait that accompanies multiple disorders. The association between loneliness and mental health indices may partly be due to inherited biological factors. We constructed polygenic scores for 27 traits related to behavior, cognition and mental health and tested their prediction for self-reported loneliness in a population-based sample of 8798 Dutch individuals. Polygenic scores for major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were significantly associated with loneliness. Of the Big Five personality dimensions, polygenic scores for neuroticism and conscientiousness also significantly predicted loneliness, as did the polygenic scores for subjective well-being, tiredness and self-rated health. When including all polygenic scores simultaneously into one model, only 2 major depression polygenic scores remained as significant predictors of loneliness. When controlling only for these 2 MDD polygenic scores, only neuroticism and schizophrenia remain significant. The total variation explained by all polygenic scores collectively was 1.7%. The association between the propensity to feel lonely and the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders thus pointed to a shared genetic etiology.

Retrospective cohort data from a six-year follow-up of HIV patients at an outpatient clinic were analyzed. MDD trajectories were identified by latent class growth analysis and generalized linear mixed models were used to examine their relation to low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (<200 cells/μL) during follow-up. Among 1,494 HIV patients, four MDD trajectory groups were identified: Low-Chronic, Moderate-Ascending, High-Episodic, and High-Chronic.

Values of GMV and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding (expressed as BP<sub>F</sub>, one of the types of binding potentials that refer to displaceable or specific binding that can be quantified in vivo with PET) were obtained in 13 regions of interest, including raphe, and at the voxel level. We used regression analysis within each group to predict GMV from BP<sub>F</sub>, while covarying for age, sex, total gray matter volume and medication status. In the HCs group, we found overall a positive correlation between terminal field 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor binding and GMV, which reached statistical significance in regions such as hippocampus, insula, orbital prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobe. We observed a trend towards inverse correlation between raphe 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor binding and anterior cingulate GMV in both groups, and a statistically significant positive correlation between raphe 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding and temporal GMV in MDD. Analysis of covariance at the voxel-level revealed a trend towards interaction between diagnosis and raphe 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding in predicting GMV in cerebellum and supramarginal gyrus (higher correlation in HCs compared with MDD). Our results replicated previous findings in the normative brain, but did not extend them to the brain in MDD, and indicated a trend towards dissociation between MDD and HCs in the relationship of raphe 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding with postsynaptic GMV.

MBIs have modulatory effects on several brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, such as the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, and the parietal cortex. These regions have been implicated in self-awareness, attention and emotion regulation. Some of these findings were consistent with the effects of MBIs observed in healthy subjects and patients with other psychiatric disorders, especially enhanced activity in the frontal and subcortical regions related to the improved somatosensory awareness. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of MBIs in MDD.',\n",

       " 'Depression risk genes in combination with childhood events have been associated with biased processing as an intermediate phenotype for depression. The aim of the present conceptual replication study was to investigate the role of biased automatic approach-avoidance tendencies as a candidate intermediate phenotype for depression, in the context of genes (5-HTTLPR polymorphism) and childhood trauma. A naturalistic remitted depressed patients sample (N = 209) performed an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) with facial expressions (angry, sad, happy and neutral). Childhood trauma was assessed with a questionnaire. Genotype groups were created based on allele frequency: LaLa versus S/Lg-carriers. The latter is associated with depression risk. We found that remitted S/Lg-carriers who experienced childhood trauma automatically avoided sad facial expressions relatively more than LaLa homozygotes with childhood trauma. Remitted LaLa-carriers who had not experienced childhood trauma, avoided sad faces relatively more than LaLa homozygotes with childhood trauma. We did not find a main effect of childhood trauma, nor differential avoidance of any of the other facial expressions. Although tentative, the results suggest that automatic approach-avoidance tendencies for disorder-congruent materials may be a fitting intermediate phenotype for depression. The specific pattern of tendencies, and the relation to depression, may depend on the genetic risk profile and childhood trauma, but replication is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.',\n",
       " 'Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique with few side effects that has been reported to be effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). At present, no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have compared the efficacy and safety of rTMS delivered by the figure-8-coil and the H1-coil. We describe an industry-independent, randomized, controlled, single-blinded, single-center study protocol assessing the differences in efficacy and safety of rTMS for patients diagnosed with MDD with the H1-coil and figure-8-coil as an add-on to stable pharmacotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone. Stimulation protocols follow those that led to the FDA clearance of these treatments for MDD. The sample of 76 patents in each of the three groups will be enrolled and assessed with clinical and neuropsychological tests. The primary outcome is remission rate defined as Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D17) score ≤7 at the end of week-4. This clinical trial will address the efficacy and safety of rTMS modalities for MDD. The evaluation of biological markers will also help to elucidate the pathophysiology of MDD and the mechanisms of action of rTMS.',\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The serotonin hypothesis may be the model of MDD pathophysiology with the most support. The majority of antidepressants enhance synaptic serotonin levels quickly, while it usually takes weeks to discern MDD treatment effect. It has been hypothesized that the time lag between serotonin increase and reduction of MDD symptoms is due to downregulation of inhibitory receptors such as the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). The research on 5-HT1BR has previously been hampered by a lack of selective ligands for the receptor. The last extensive review of 5-HT1BR in the pathophysiology of depression was published 2009, and based mainly on findings from animal studies. Since then, selective radioligands for in vivo quantification of brain 5-HT1BR binding with positron emission tomography has been developed, providing new knowledge on the role of 5-HT1BR in MDD and its treatment. The main focus of this review is the role of 5-HT1BR in relation to MDD and its treatment, although studies of 5-HT1BR in obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol dependence, and cocaine dependence are also reviewed. The evidence outlined range from animal models of disease, effects of 5-HT1B receptor agonists and antagonists, case-control studies of 5-HT1B receptor binding postmortem and in vivo, with positron emission tomography, to clinical studies of 5-HT1B receptor effects of established treatments for MDD. Low 5-HT1BR binding in limbic regions has been found in MDD patients. When 5-HT1BR ligands are administered to animals, 5-HT1BR agonists most consistently display antidepressant-like properties, though it is not yet clear how 5-HT1BR is best approached for optimal MDD treatment.',\n",

       " 'Anhedonia (hyposensitivity to rewards) and negative bias (hypersensitivity to punishments) are core features of major depressive disorder (MDD), which could stem from abnormal reinforcement learning. Emerging evidence highlights blunted reward learning and reward prediction error (RPE) signaling in the striatum in MDD, although inconsistencies exist. Preclinical studies have clarified that ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons encode RPE and habenular neurons encode punishment prediction error (PPE), which are then transmitted to the striatum and cortex to guide goal-directed behavior. However, few studies have probed striatal activation, and functional connectivity between VTA-striatum and VTA-habenula during reward and punishment learning respectively, in unmedicated MDD. To fill this gap, we acquired fMRI data from 25 unmedicated MDD and 26 healthy individuals during a monetary instrumental learning task and utilized a computational modeling approach to characterize underlying neural correlates of RPE and PPE. Relative to controls, MDD individuals showed impaired reward learning, blunted RPE signal in the striatum and overall reduced VTA-striatal connectivity to feedback. Critically, striatal RPE signal was increasingly blunted with more major depressive episodes (MDEs). No group differences emerged in PPE signals in the habenula and VTA or in connectivity between these regions. However, PPE signals in the habenula correlated positively with number of MDEs. These results highlight impaired reward learning, disrupted RPE signaling in the striatum (particularly among individuals with more lifetime MDEs) as well as reduced VTA-striatal connectivity in MDD. Collectively, these findings highlight reward-related learning deficits in MDD and their underlying pathophysiology.',\n",

Understanding cognitive performance in MDD could provide a wider insight in the aetiology of MDD as a whole. Using a large, well characterised cohort (N\\u2009=\\u20097012), we tested for: differences in cognitive performance by MDD status and a gene (single SNP or polygenic score) by MDD interaction effect on cognitive performance. Linear regression was used to assess the association between cognitive performance and MDD status in a case-control, single-episode-recurrent MDD and control-recurrent MDD study design. Test scores on verbal declarative memory, executive functioning, vocabulary, and processing speed were examined. Cognitive performance measures showing a significant difference between groups were subsequently analysed for genetic associations.

       " 'Genetic, dietary, and inflammatory factors contribute to the etiology of major mood disorders (MMD), thus impeding the identification of specific biomarkers to assist in diagnosis and treatment. We tested association of vitamin D and inflammatory markers in 36 adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) forms of MMD and without MMD (non-mood control). We also assessed the overall level of inflammation using a cell-based reporter assay for nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) activation and measuring antibodies to oxidized LDL. We found that these factors were similar between non-mood and MMD youth. To identify potential biomarkers, we developed a screening immunoprecipitation-sequencing approach based on inflammatory brain glia maturation factor beta (GMFβ). We discovered that a homolog of GMFβ in human plasma is vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and validated this finding using immunoprecipitation with anti-DBP antibodies and mass spectrometry/sequencing analysis. We quantified DBP levels in participants by western blot. DBP levels in BD participants were significantly higher (136%) than in participants without MMD (100%). The increase in DBP levels in MDD participants (121.1%) was not statistically different from these groups. The DBP responds early to cellular damage by binding of structural proteins and activating inflammatory cells. A product of enzymatic cleavage of DBP has been described as macrophage-activating factor. Circulating DBP is comprised of heterogenous high and low molecular fractions that are only partially recognized by mono- and polyclonal ELISA and are not suitable for the quantitative comparison of DBP in non-mood and MDD participants. Our data suggest DBP as a marker candidate of BD warranting its validation in a larger cohort of adolescent and adult MMD patients.',\n",

Compared to those in HVC, participants in IBM-H reported more benign interpretations and fewer hostile interpretations at posttreatment. No difference in depressive interpretation bias was found between groups at posttreatment. IBM-H led to improved anger control at posttreatment and follow-up compared to HVC, though no effects of condition were found on trait anger or depressive symptoms. The IBM-H group perceived their treatment as less credible than the HVC group. For individuals with high expectancy of treatment success, IBM-H led to lower posttreatment depressive symptoms compared to HVC, while findings trended in the opposite direction for those with low expectancy of success. Overall, these preliminary findings point to boundary conditions for the efficacy of IBM protocols for anger and depression and potential improvements to be made to future IBM protocols.',\n",

Methods The modified Sternberg WM paradigm with positive, negative, and neutral emotional pictures was used to investigate the WM abilities of 26 patients with MDD and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Results No significant difference in picture WM was found between the MDD and HC groups; however, the accuracy of picture position WM was significantly lower and the response time was significantly longer in the MDD than HC group, regardless of the picture or position WM. Additionally, in the MDD group, the accuracy of negative picture/position WM was significantly higher than that of positive picture/position WM. Conclusions These results suggest that in patients with MDD, spatial WM impairment was more severe than object WM. In addition, these patients' WM retrieval was impaired, resulting in a decrease in WM retrieval ability, which may be an important cause of the slow thought in patients with MDD.

In a multilevel logistic regression analysis, neighborhood-level discrimination as well as individual-level variables including the number of negative life events, financial strain, and negative affectivity were found to be significant predictors of developing MDD. Analyses of cross-level interactions indicated that the effects of neighborhood-level discrimination were moderated by the quality of individuals' relationships, such that better relationships with others served to lessen the effect of neighborhood discrimination on depression.

       " \"In the second part we focus on two treatment strategies that may overcome the main limitations of current antidepressant drugs. First, we review the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the use of glutamatergic drugs as fast-acting antidepressants. Secondly, we review the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the use of small RNAs (e.g.., small interfering RNAs or siRNAs) to knockdown genes in monoaminergic and non-monoaminergic neurons and induce antidepressant-like responses in experimental animals. The development of glutamatergic agents is a promising venue for antidepressant drug development, given the antidepressant properties of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Its unique properties appear to result from the activation of AMPA receptors by a metabolite [(2S,6S;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK)] and mTOR signaling. These effects increase synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons and enhance serotonergic neurotransmission via descending inputs to the raphe nuclei. This view is supported by the cancellation of ketamine's antidepressant-like effects by inhibition of serotonin synthesis. We also review existing evidence supporting the involvement of miRNAs in MDD and the preclinical use of RNA interference (RNAi) strategies to target genes involved in antidepressant response. Many miRNAs have been associated to MDD, some of which e.g., miR-135 targets genes involved in antidepressant actions. Likewise, SSRI-conjugated siRNA evokes faster and/or more effective antidepressant-like responses. Intranasal application of sertraline-conjugated siRNAs directed to 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and SERT evoked much faster changes of pre- and postsynaptic antidepressant markers than those produced by fluoxetine.\",\n",

Corticolimbic alterations reported in emotion dysregulation and depression may be one possible link. We examined the relationships between emotion dysregulation in school age, corticolimbic resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) in preadolescence, and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Participants were 143 children from a longitudinal preschool onset depression study who completed the Children Sadness Management Scale (CSMS; measuring ER), Child Depression Inventory (CDI-C; measuring depressive symptoms), and two resting-state MRI scans. Rs-FC between four primary regions of interest (ROIs; bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC] and amygdala) and six target ROIs thought to contribute to ER were examined. Findings showed that ER in school age did not predict depressive symptoms in adolescence, but did predict preadolescent increases in dlPFC-insula and dlPFC-ventromedial PFC rs-FC across diagnosis, as well as increased dlPFC-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) rs-FC in children with a history of depression. Of these profiles, only dlPFC-dACC rs-FC in preadolescence predicted depressive symptoms in adolescence. However, dlPFC-dACC connectivity did not mediate the relationship between ER in school age and depressive symptoms in adolescence. Despite the absence of a direct relationship between ER and depressive symptoms and no significant rs-FC mediation, the rs-FC profiles predicted by ER are consistent with the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation is associated with abnormalities in top-down control functions.

In this review, we have summarised recent accomplishments regarding the role of connexins, gap junctions, and hemichannels in the aetiology of MDD, and discussed the limitations of current research. A blockage of gap junctions or hemichannels induces depressive behaviour. Possible underlying mechanisms include the regulation of neurosecretory functions and synaptic activity by gap junctions and hemichannels. Gap junctions are functionally inhibited under stress conditions. Conversely, hemichannel permeability is increased. Antidepressants inhibit hemichannel permeability; however, they have contrasting effects on the function of gap junctions under normal conditions and can protect them against stress.

However, the role of complement components in MDD is not well understood. Here, we found significant increase in component 3 (C3) expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of depressed suicide subjects. We tested the role of altered C3 expression in mouse model of depression and found that increased C3 expression in PFC as a result of chronic stress causes depressive-like behavior. Conversely, mice lacking C3 were resilient to stress-induced depressive-like behavior. Moreover, selective overexpression of C3 in PFC was sufficient to cause depressive-like behavior in mice. We found that C3a (activated product of C3) receptor, C3aR+ monocytes were infiltrated into PFC following chronic stress. However, C3aR knockout mice displayed significantly reduced monocyte recruitment into PFC and reduced levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in PFC after chronic stress. In addition, C3aR knockout mice did not exhibit chronic stress-induced behavior despair. Similarly, chronic stress-induced increases in C3aR+ monocytes and IL-1β in PFC, and depressive-like behavior were attenuated by myeloid cell depletion.

There are significant regional variations in the rates of MDD and suicide in the United States, suggesting that sociodemographic and environmental conditions contribute. Here, we review epidemiological evidence that increases in the altitude of residence are linked to the increased risk of depression and suicide. We consider the possibility that chronic hypobaric hypoxia (low blood oxygen related to low atmospheric pressure) contributes to suicide and depression, which is suggested by animal models, short-term studies in humans, and the effects of hypoxic medical conditions on suicide and depression. We argue that hypobaric hypoxia could promote suicide and depression by altering serotonin metabolism and brain bioenergetics; both of these pathways are implicated in depression, and both are affected by hypoxia.

In contrast, ketamine produces rapid-onset antidepressant, anti-suicidal, and anti-anhedonic actions following a single administration to patients with depression. Proposed mechanisms of the antidepressant action of ketamine include N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulation, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneuron disinhibition, and direct actions of its hydroxynorketamine (HNK) metabolites. Downstream actions include activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, and activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). These putative mechanisms of ketamine action are not mutually exclusive and may complement each other to induce potentiation of excitatory synapses in affective-regulating brain circuits, which results in amelioration of depression symptoms. We review these proposed mechanisms of ketamine action in the context of how such mechanisms are informing the development of novel putative rapid-acting antidepressant drugs. Such drugs that have undergone pre-clinical, and in some cases clinical, testing include the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine, GluN2B-NMDAR antagonists (i.e., CP-101,606, MK-0657), (2R,6R)-HNK, NMDAR glycine site modulators (i.e., 4-chlorokynurenine, pro-drug of the glycine<sub>B</sub> NMDAR antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid), NMDAR agonists [i.e., GLYX-13 (rapastinel)], metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR<sub>2/3</sub>) antagonists, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators, and drugs acting on various serotonin receptor subtypes.

For this cross-sectional case-control study, we recruited antidepressant-free patients with MDD without any somatic or psychiatric comorbidities (<i>n</i>\\u2009=\\u200920), who were individually matched for sex, age, body mass index, and smoking status to a non-depressed control subject (<i>n</i>\\u2009=\\u200920). T cell phenotype and repertoire were interrogated using a combination of flow cytometry, gene expression analysis, and next generation sequencing. T cells from MDD patients showed significantly lower surface expression of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6, which are known to be central to T cell differentiation and trafficking. In addition, we observed a shift within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment characterized by a higher frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup>CD127<sup>low/-</sup> cells and higher <i>FOXP3</i> mRNA expression in purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells obtained from patients with MDD. Finally, flow cytometry-based TCR Vβ repertoire analysis indicated a less diverse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire in MDD, which was corroborated by next generation sequencing of the TCR β chain CDR3 region. Overall, these results suggest that T cell phenotype and TCR utilization are skewed on several levels in patients with MDD. Our study identifies putative cellular and molecular signatures of dysregulated adaptive immunity and reinforces the notion that T cells are a pathophysiologically relevant cell population in this disorder.',\n",

This analysis aimed to characterize PLWH enrolled in the representative ANRS-VESPA2 survey, aware of and concerned about convictions for HIV transmission. Being a migrant from Sub-Saharan Africa, having difficult socio-economic conditions, having unprotected sex with one's main partner and concealing one's HIV status were all factors statistically associated with concern about the sentences. Participants tempted to press charges against someone for infecting them were more likely to be younger, women, not living in a couple, unemployed, and to report a major depressive disorder. Concern about HIV-related criminal proceedings among the most vulnerable PLWH do not reflect the actual risk of prosecution they are exposed to.\",\n",

In addition, a difference in P1 amplitude change to a red background compared to its opponent color, green, has been found in schizophrenia-spectrum samples. The current study examined whether specific psychiatric symptoms that related to these P1 abnormalities in earlier studies would be replicated when using a broad transdiagnostic sample. The final sample consisted of 135 participants: 26 with bipolar disorders, 25 with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, 19 with unipolar depression, 62 with no current psychiatric disorder, and 3 with disorders in other categories. Low (8%) and high (64%) contrast check arrays were presented on gray, green, and red background conditions during electroencephalogram, while an eye tracker monitored visual fixation on the stimuli. Linear regressions across the entire sample (N\\u202f=\\u202f135) found that greater severity of both clinician-rated and self-reported delusions/magical thinking correlated with a reduced P1 amplitude on the low contrast gray (neutral) background condition. In addition, across the entire sample, higher self-reported constricted affect was associated with a larger decrease in P1 amplitude (averaged across contrast conditions) to the red, compared to green, background. All relationships remained statistically significant after covarying for diagnostic class, suggesting that they are relatively transdiagnostic in nature. These findings indicate that early visual processing abnormalities may be more directly related to specific transdiagnostic symptoms such as delusions and constricted affect rather than specific psychiatric diagnoses or broad symptom factor scales.',\n",
       " 'Rates of suicide and major depressive disorder (MDD) are currently at the highest point in the history of the United States (US). However, these rates are not distributed evenly among the population and Latinos show disproportionately high rates of both suicide and MDD. Yet, past research has infrequently explored factors related to suicide and MDD in primary care settings that serve as the major community portal for mental health among the Latino population. Thus, the current study investigated sociodemographic variables (marital status, nativity, education, employment, primary language, age, and gender) in terms of their relations with suicidal ideation, suicide risk, MDD, and MDD symptom severity among Latino primary care patients in a Federally Qualified Health Center (N\\xa0=\\xa0634, M <sub>age</sub>\\xa0=\\xa039.46, SD\\xa0=\\xa011.46, 87.1% female). Results indicated that gender and Nativity were associated with suicidal ideation, older age was associated with suicide risk, and higher education and having a partner were negatively associated with MDD and depressive symptom severity. These results provide novel insight into the role of sociodemographic factors predicting suicide and MDD among Latinos in primary care, and suggest greater scientific and clinical attention can be focused on certain sociodemographic factors to offset mental health disparities among this group.',\n",
       " 'Default mode network (DMN) dysfunction (particularly within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)) has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, its contribution to treatment outcome has not been clearly established. Here we tested the role of DMN functional connectivity as a general and differential biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes in a large, unmedicated adult sample with MDD. Seventy-five MDD outpatients completed fMRI scans before and 8 weeks after randomization to escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR. A whole-brain voxel-wise t-test identified profiles of pretreatment intrinsic functional connectivity that distinguished patients who were subsequently classified as remitters or non-remitters at follow-up. Connectivity was seeded in the PCC, an important node of the DMN. We further characterized differences between remitters, non-remitters, and 31 healthy controls and characterized changes pretreatment to posttreatment. Remitters were distinguished from non-remitters by relatively intact connectivity between the PCC and ACC/mPFC, not distinguishable from healthy controls, while non-remitters showed relative hypo-connectivity. In validation analyses, we demonstrate that PCC-ACC/mPFC connectivity predicts remission status with >80% cross-validated accuracy. In analyses testing whether intrinsic connectivity differentially relates to outcomes for a specific type of antidepressant, interaction models did not survive the corrected threshold. Our findings demonstrate that the overall capacity to remit on commonly used antidepressants may depend on intact organization of intrinsic functional connectivity between PCC and ACC/mPFC prior to treatment. The findings highlight the potential utility of functional scans for advancing a more precise approach to tailoring antidepressant treatment choices.',\n",
       " 'Stress-related alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, a neurotrophin that plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, are believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. Here, we show that in a chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression the Gαi1 and Gαi3 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are down-regulated in the hippocampus, a key limbic structure associated with major depressive disorder. We provide evidence that Gαi1 and Gαi3 (Gαi1/3) are required for the activation of TrkB downstream signaling pathways. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and CNS neurons, Gαi1/3 knockdown inhibited BDNF-induced tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) endocytosis, adaptor protein activation, and Akt-mTORC1 and Erk-MAPK signaling. Functional studies show that Gαi1 and Gαi3 knockdown decreases the number of dendrites and dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons. In vivo, hippocampal Gαi1/3 knockdown after bilateral microinjection of lentiviral constructs containing Gαi1 and Gαi3 shRNA elicited depressive behaviors. Critically, exogenous expression of Gαi3 in the hippocampus reversed depressive behaviors in CMS mice. Similar results were observed in Gαi1/Gαi3 double-knockout mice, which exhibited severe depressive behaviors. These results demonstrate that heterotrimeric Gαi1 and Gαi3 proteins are essential for TrkB signaling and that disruption of Gαi1 or Gαi3 function could contribute to depressive behaviors.',\n",

Baseline characteristics and outcome criteria at discharge were compared between distinct subtypes and their overlap. A substantial proportion of patients (16%) were classified with more than one subtype of depression, 28% were of the distinct anxious, 7% of the distinct atypical and 5% of the distinct melancholic subtype. Distinct melancholic patients had shortest duration of episode, highest baseline depression severity, but were more often early improvers; distinct anxious patients had higher NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) neuroticism scores compared with patients with unspecific subtype. Melancholic patients with overlap of anxious features had worse treatment outcome compared to distinct melancholic and distinct anxious subtype. Distinct subtypes differed in only few variables and patients with overlap of depression subtypes may have independent clinical and outcome characteristics.

We evaluated whether the 4 classes of antidepressants currently most prescribed as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) have the potential to alter <sup>123</sup>I-MIBG imaging results. <b>Methods:</b> The inhibition effect of desipramine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and bupropion on <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG uptake was assessed by in vitro uptake assays using human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of tracer uptake was determined from dose-response curves. To evaluate the effect of intravenous pretreatment with desipramine (1.5 mg/kg) and escitalopram (2.5 or 15 mg/kg) on <sup>123</sup>I-MIBG cardiac uptake, in vivo planar <sup>123</sup>I-MIBG scanning of healthy New Zealand White rabbits was performed. <b>Results:</b> The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of desipramine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and bupropion on <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG cellular uptake were 11.9 nM, 7.5 μM, 4.92 μM, and 12.9 μM, respectively.

       " 'In December 2015, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists published a comprehensive set of mood disorder clinical practice guidelines for psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health professionals. This guideline summary, directed broadly at primary care physicians, is an abridged version that focuses on major depression. It emphasises the importance of shared decision making, tailoring personalised care to the individual, and delivering care in the context of a therapeutic relationship. In practice, the management of depression is determined by a multitude of factors, including illness severity and putative aetiology, with the principal objectives of regaining premorbid functioning and improving resilience against recurrence of future episodes. Main recommendations: The guidelines emphasise a biopsychosocial lifestyle approach and provide the following specific clinical recommendations: Alongside or before prescribing any form of treatment, consideration should be given to the implementation of strategies to manage stress, ensure appropriate sleep hygiene and enable uptake of healthy lifestyle changes. For mild to moderate depression, psychological management alone is an appropriate first line treatment, especially early in the course of illness. For moderate to severe depression, pharmacological management is usually necessary and is recommended first line, ideally in conjunction with psychosocial interventions. Changes in management as a result of the guidelines: The management of depression is anchored within a therapeutic relationship that attends to biopsychosocial lifestyle aspects and psychiatric diagnosis. The guidelines promote a broader approach to the formulation and management of depression, with treatments tailored to depressive subtypes and administered with clear steps in mind. Lifestyle and psychological therapies are favoured for less severe presentations, and concurrent antidepressant prescription is reserved for more severe and otherwise treatment-refractory cases.',\n",
       " \"A close association between vegetative regulation and affect is common knowledge. Recently, the role of aldosterone and the activity of its receptor [mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)] in the clinical outcome for treatment with standard antidepressants has been shown including low systolic blood pressure and a low concentration of plasma sodium (Na), both of which appear to be related to therapy resistance to standard antidepressants. We carried out a retrospective analysis of a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of St John's wort extract LI160 in 247 outpatients with major depression. The study did not show a difference between the treatment groups; therefore, a pooled dataset of the 6-week completer population of the trial was analyzed. The focus was on the moderating effect of blood pressure and electrolytes on clinical outcome (relative change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). Low Na/K ratio and high K at screening predicted worse outcome after 6 weeks as measures with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (P<0.01). Systolic blood pressure at the same time point did not influence the treatment outcome. In conclusion, signs of reduced peripheral MR sensitivity, as reflected by a lower plasma Na/K ratio and/or higher K concentration, predict worse outcome. This is in line with our recent data as well as neuroendocrine findings. The data indicate that widely collected biomarkers, which are related to MR activity, may be useful to identify patients, who are at risk of nonresponse to antidepressant treatment.\",\n",

The purpose of the study is to determine the cognitive performance in first episode depression (FED) exploring the presence of different cognitive profiles, and the role of cognition in FED at baseline and long-term. Ninety subjects (18-50 years) were included, 50 patients with a FED and 40 healthy controls. Participants were assessed with a neuropsychological battery, covering language, attention, verbal memory, processing speed and executive domains. Neuropsychological group comparisons were performed with MANOVAs. A hierarchical cluster analysis was run to identify clusters of patients with similar neuropsychological performance. Two generalized linear models were built to predict baseline HDRS-17 and changes at 12 months. Patients performed significantly worse than healthy controls in language, attention/working memory, verbal memory, processing speed and executive functioning, with moderate to large effect sizes (0.5 - 1). Two clusters were found: cognitively preserved patients (n=37) and cognitively impaired patients (n=13). Large effect sizes of cognitive impairment in FED were observed between the two cognitive clusters (preserved and impaired). Depressive symptoms at baseline were predicted by verbal memory (p=0.003), while 12-month changes were predicted by executive function (p=0.041) and language (p=0.037).

However, these predictors are either subjective or complex, which has limited their clinical use. Thus, we aimed to identify an objective and easy-to-get marker to predict early therapeutic efficacy. Forty-seven drug-naïve patients with MDD and 47 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans.

Compared with the non-responding depression (NRD) group, the treatment-responsive depression (TRD) group had a higher VC. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that the VC exhibited a good ability to differentiate TRD from NRD. In addition, the linear and logistic regression analyses showed that the VC was a significant predictor of the decline rate of HRSD scores and the antidepressant treatment response.

Hieronymus et al. accused us of methodological inaccuracies and blatant errors. In their post-hoc analysis of our data, they reported that SSRIs only increase the risk of SAEs in elderly and seems safe for non-elderly patients. They also found our review misleading because our efficacy analyses were based on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; we included suboptimal SSRI doses; and we missed some 'pivotal trials'. We do not agree with Hieronymus et al. regarding several of the 'errors' they claim that we have made. However, we acknowledge that they have identified minor errors and that we missed some trials. After rectifying the errors and inclusion of the missed trials by us and Hieronymus et al., we re-analysed the data. The updated analyses are even more robust and confirm our earlier conclusions. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of an SAE both in non-elderly (p=0.045) and elderly (p=0.01) patients [overall odds ratio 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.73; p=0.002; I2=0%]. Moreover, SSRIs did not change noticeably the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the internationally accepted scale (mean difference -2.02 points; 95% CI -2.38 to -1.66; p<0.00001).

       " 'Brain imaging reveals schizophrenia as a disorder of macroscopic brain networks. In particular, default mode and salience network (DMN, SN) show highly consistent alterations in both interacting brain activity and underlying brain structure. However, the same networks are also altered in major depression. This overlap in network alterations induces the question whether DMN and SN changes are different across both disorders, potentially indicating distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. To address this question, we acquired T1-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and resting-state functional MRI in patients with schizophrenia, patients with major depression, and healthy controls. We measured regional gray matter volume, inter-regional structural and intrinsic functional connectivity of DMN and SN, and compared these measures across groups by generalized Wilcoxon rank tests, while controlling for symptoms and medication. When comparing patients with controls, we found in each patient group SN volume loss, impaired DMN structural connectivity, and aberrant DMN and SN functional connectivity. When comparing patient groups, SN gray matter volume loss and DMN structural connectivity reduction did not differ between groups, but in schizophrenic patients, functional hyperconnectivity between DMN and SN was less in comparison to depressed patients. Results provide evidence for distinct functional hyperconnectivity between DMN and SN in schizophrenia and major depression, while structural changes in DMN and SN were similar. Distinct hyperconnectivity suggests different pathophysiological mechanism underlying aberrant DMN-SN interactions in schizophrenia and depression.',\n",

       " \"Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents approximately 40% of the disability caused by mental illnesses globally. The poorly understood pathophysiology and limited efficiency of pharmacological treatment (based primarily on the principles of the monoaminergic hypothesis) make depression a serious medical, public and socio-economical problem. An increasing number of studies suggest that epigenetic modifications (alterations in gene expression that are not due to changes in DNA sequence) in certain brain regions and neural circuits represent a key mechanism through which environmental factors interact with individual's genetic constitution to affect risk of mental disorders. Accordingly, chromatin-based epigenetic regulation seems to be a promising direction for the development of new, more effective antidepressant drugs. Recently, several inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) have been extensively studied in the context of antidepressant action. So far, none of them has been used to treat depression in humans due to the low selectivity for specific HDAC isoforms, and consequently, a risk of serious adverse events. In this review, we focus on the HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) with the greatest antidepressant efficacy and their activity in the preclinical studies. Moreover, we discuss their potential therapeutic usefulness in depression and the main limitations.\",\n",

Subjects comprised 89 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), 66 patients with bipolar disorder (BPD), 96 patients with schizophrenia, and 117 healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and ethnicity (Japanese). Diagnosis was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, criteria. CSF C5 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CSF C5 levels were significantly increased in the patients with MDD (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001) and in the patients with schizophrenia (p\\u202f=\\u202f0.001), compared with the healthy controls.

Older age, male sex, and greater body mass index tended to associate with higher C5 levels. There was a significantly positive correlation between C5 levels and chlorpromazine-equivalent dose in the patients with schizophrenia. Thus, we found, for the first time, elevated C5 levels in the CSF of patients with major psychiatric disorders.

Additionally, copy number of mtDNA (mtDNA-cn) can be quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s, indirectly reflecting cellular energetics, or in the circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) levels, which may reflect a fraction of the mitochondrial genome released during cellular stress. Few studies have examined ccf-mtDNA in MDD, and no studies have tested its relationship with intracellular mtDNA-cn or with antidepressant treatment response. Here, mtDNA levels were quantified in parallel from: (i) PBMCs and (ii) cell-free plasma of 50 unmedicated MDD subjects and 55 controls, in parallel with PBMC telomere length (TL) and antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GpX) activity. MtDNA measures were repeated in 19 MDD subjects after 8 weeks of open-label SSRI treatment.

       " \"Amitifadine, the only drug ever clinically tested in Phase 3 for treating depression, is a triple reuptake inhibitor (TRI) that simultaneously interacts with human monoamine transporters (MATs) including hSERT, hNET and hDAT. This novel multi-target strategy improves drug efficacy and reduces the toxic side effects of drugs. However, the binding modes accounting for amitifadine's polypharmacological mode of action are still elusive, and extensive exploration of the amitifadine-target interactions between amitifadine and MATs is urgently needed. In this study, a total of 0.63 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an explicit solvent as well as endpoint binding free energy (BFE) calculation were carried out. MD simulation results identified a shared binding mode involving eleven key residues at the S1 site of MATs for the binding of amitifadine, and the results of the BFE calculations were in good agreement with experimental reports. Moreover, by analyzing the per-residue energy contribution variation at the S1 site of three MATs and additional cross-mutagenesis simulations, the variation in the inhibition ratio of amitifadine between hSERT and two other MATs was discovered to mainly come from non-conserved residues (Y95, I172 and T439 in hNET and Y95, I172, A169 and T439 in hDAT). As the rational inhibition ratio of multi-target drugs among various therapeutic targets was found to be the key to their safety and tolerance, the findings of this study may further facilitate the rational design of more potent but less toxic multi-target antidepressant drugs.\",\n",

We identified 19 metabolites and elucidated their structures using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) combined with elemental compositions derived from accurate mass measurements. We further used online H/D exchange experiments to verify the structural elucidations of each metabolite. Identifying molecular metabolites may provide critical insights into the pharmacological and clinical effects of ECTP treatment and may also provide useful information informing the development of new antidepressant treatments.

Therefore, ammonia metabolism genes may link a range of diseases involving glutamate signaling such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We analyzed data from a National Institute on Aging study with a family-based design to determine if 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in glutaminase (GLS), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), or glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) genes were associated with AD, MDD, or T2D using PLINK software. HAPLOVIEW software was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium measures for the SNPs. Next, we analyzed the associated variations for potential effects on transcriptional control sites to identify possible functional effects of the SNPs. Of the SNPs that passed the quality control tests, four SNPs in the GLS gene were significantly associated with AD, two SNPs in the GLS gene were associated with T2D, and one SNP in the GLUL gene and three SNPs in the CPS1 gene were associated with MDD before Bonferroni correction. The in silico bioinformatic analysis suggested probable functional roles for six associated SNPs. Glutamate signaling pathways have been implicated in all these diseases, and other studies have detected similar brain pathologies such as cortical thinning in AD, MDD, and T2D. Taken together, these data potentially link GLS with AD, GLS with T2D, and CPS1 and GLUL with MDD and stimulate the generation of testable hypotheses that may help explain the molecular basis of pathologies shared by these disorders.\",\n",

The advantage of ECT is therapeutic response that occurs significantly earlier than during pharmacotherapy. Initially ECTwas used without anesthesia. Then, in the 1950s procedures with general anesthesia were introduced to reduce the complications that may occur during a seizure caused by ECT, such as broken bones, teeth, tendon rupture, muscle damage. Currently, in general anesthesia for ECTseveral medications are used interchangeably: thiopental, propofol, etomidate and ketamine. In different resorts and different countries different anestethics are used, the choice is determined mainly by the experience of each resort and a kind of tradition. The authors provide an overview of objective data showing how various anesthetics affect the quality of ECT and the presence of any hemodynamic complications after ETC. Selection of articles included in this paper was made by searching Medline and PubMed databases using specific keywords: electroconvulsive therapy, general anesthesia, the risks and benefits of thiopental, ketamine, propofol and etomidate. The results of this review are inconclusive when it comes to the effect of intravenous anesthetics on the quality of the ECT treatment and side effects relating to respiratory and cardiovascular system. On this basis it is impossible to determine which of intravenous anesthetics is most advantageous from the point of view of the patient. To develop the optimum scheme of anesthesia for ECT, it is necessary to conduct further, methodologically correct studies.',\n",

       " 'High-order functional connectivity networks are rich in time information that can reflect dynamic changes in functional connectivity between brain regions. Accordingly, such networks are widely used to classify brain diseases. However, traditional methods for processing high-order functional connectivity networks generally include the clustering method, which reduces data dimensionality. As a result, such networks cannot be effectively interpreted in the context of neurology. Additionally, due to the large scale of high-order functional connectivity networks, it can be computationally very expensive to use complex network or graph theory to calculate certain topological properties. Here, we propose a novel method of generating a high-order minimum spanning tree functional connectivity network. This method increases the neurological significance of the high-order functional connectivity network, reduces network computing consumption, and produces a network scale that is conducive to subsequent network analysis. To ensure the quality of the topological information in the network structure, we used frequent subgraph mining technology to capture the discriminative subnetworks as features and combined this with quantifiable local network features. Then we applied a multikernel learning technique to the corresponding selected features to obtain the final classification results. We evaluated our proposed method using a data set containing 38 patients with major depressive disorder and 28 healthy controls.

Liver is vulnerable to exposure of bacterial products translocated from the gut via the portal vein and may be involved in the axis. In this study, germ-free mice underwent fecal microbiota transplantation from MDD patients and healthy controls. Behavioral tests verified the depression model. Metabolomics using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry determined the influence of microbes on liver metabolism. With multivariate statistical analysis, 191 metabolites were distinguishable in MDD mice from control (CON) mice. Compared with CON mice, MDD mice showed lower levels for 106 metabolites and higher levels for 85 metabolites. These metabolites are associated with lipid and energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Combined analyses of significantly changed proteins in livers from another depression model induced by chronic unpredictive mild stress returned a high score for the Lipid Metabolism, Free Radical Scavenging, and Molecule Transports network, and canonical pathways were involved in energy metabolism and tryptophan degradation. The two mouse models of depression suggest that changes in liver metabolism might be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. Conjoint analyses of fecal, serum, liver, and hippocampal metabolites from fecal microbiota transplantation mice suggested that aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis significantly changed and fecal metabolites showed a close relationship with the liver. These findings may help determine the biological mechanisms of depression and provide evidence about \"depression microbes\" impacting on liver metabolism.',\n",

Thus, there is a need for markers reliably predicting ECT non/response. In our study, we have taken a novel translational approach for discovering potential biomarkers for the prediction of ECT response. Our hypothesis was that the promoter methylation of p11, a multifunctional protein involved in both depressive-like states and antidepressant treatment responses, is differently regulated in ECT responders vs. nonresponders and thus be a putative biomarker of ECT response. The chronic mild stress model of MDD was adapted with the aim to obtain rats that are resistant to conventional antidepressant drugs (citalopram). Subsequently, electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) was used to select responders and nonresponders, and compare p11 expression and promoter methylation. In the rat experiments we found that the gene promoter methylation and expression of p11 significantly correlate with the antidepressant effect of ECS. Next, we investigated the predictive properties of p11 promoter methylation in two clinical cohorts of patients with pharmacoresistant MDD. In a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 11 patients with refractory MDD, higher p11 promoter methylation was found in responders to ECT. This finding was replicated in an independent sample of 65 patients with pharmacoresistant MDD. This translational study successfully validated the first biomarker reliably predicting the responsiveness to ECT. Prescreening of this biomarker could help to identify patients eligible for first-line ECT treatment and also help to develop novel antidepressant treatment procedures for depressed patients resistant to all currently approved antidepressant treatments.',\n",
       " \"Parallel clinical and preclinical research have begun to illuminate the biological basis of stress-related disorders, including major depression, but translational bridges informing discrete mechanistic targets for intervention are missing. To address this critical need, we used structural MRI in a mouse model and in a large human sample to examine stress effects on brain structure that may be conserved across species. Specifically, we focused on a previously unexplored approach, whole-brain structural covariance, as it reflects synchronized changes in neuroanatomy, potentially due to mutual trophic influences or shared plasticity across regions. Using the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm in mouse we first demonstrate that UCMS-induced elevated behavioral emotionality correlates with increased size of the amygdala and other corticolimbic regions. We further identify focal increases in the amygdala's 'hubness' (degree and strength) set against the background of a global stress-related loss of network clustering and modularity. These macroscopic changes are supported on the molecular level by increased postsynaptic density-95 protein in the amygdala, consistent with stress-induced plastic changes and synaptic strengthening. Finally, we provide clinical evidence that strikingly similar structural network reorganization patterns exist in young adults reporting high childhood trauma and increased mood symptoms. Collectively, we provide initial translational evidence for a conserved stress-related increase in amygdala-centered structural synchrony, as measured by enhanced structural covariance, which is paralleled by a decrease in global structural synchrony. This putative trade-off reflected in increased amygdala-centered plastic changes at the expense of global structural dedifferentiation may represent a mechanistic pathway for depression and related psychopathology.\",\n",
       " \"Mood disorders represent one of society's most costly and challenging health burdens. The drug treatments used today were initially discovered serendipitously in the 1950s. Animal models were then developed based on the ability of these drugs to alter specific behaviours.

       " 'Because of the compartmentalization of disciplines that shaped the academic landscape of biology and biomedical sciences in the past, physiological systems have long been studied in isolation from each other. This has particularly been the case for the immune system. As a consequence of its ties with pathology and microbiology, immunology as a discipline has largely grown independently of physiology. Accordingly, it has taken a long time for immunologists to accept the concept that the immune system is not self-regulated but functions in close association with the nervous system. These associations are present at different levels of organization. At the local level, there is clear evidence for the production and use of immune factors by the central nervous system and for the production and use of neuroendocrine mediators by the immune system. Short-range interactions between immune cells and peripheral nerve endings innervating immune organs allow the immune system to recruit local neuronal elements for fine tuning of the immune response. Reciprocally, immune cells and mediators play a regulatory role in the nervous system and participate in the elimination and plasticity of synapses during development as well as in synaptic plasticity at adulthood. At the whole organism level, long-range interactions between immune cells and the central nervous system allow the immune system to engage the rest of the body in the fight against infection from pathogenic microorganisms and permit the nervous system to regulate immune functioning. Alterations in communication pathways between the immune system and the nervous system can account for many pathological conditions that were initially attributed to strict organ dysfunction. This applies in particular to psychiatric disorders and several immune-mediated diseases. This review will show how our understanding of this balance between long-range and short-range interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system has evolved over time, since the first demonstrations of immune influences on brain functions. The necessary complementarity of these two modes of communication will then be discussed. Finally, a few examples will illustrate how dysfunction in these communication pathways results in what was formerly considered in psychiatry and immunology to be strict organ pathologies.',\n",

Here we examined spatial selectivity, temporal uniqueness, metabolic basis, and therapeutic response of altered functional connectivity (FC) in MDD by analyzing both cross-sectional and longitudinal multimodal functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 35 patients and 34 demographically matched healthy controls. First, based on a voxel-wise, data-driven, graph-based degree centrality approach, the bilateral anterior cingulate gyri, middle frontal gyri and superior frontal gyri, and the right parahippocampal gyrus were robustly identified to show decreased FC in MDD. Further spatiotemporal analyses revealed that these regions exhibited hub-like features and were selectively located in limbic and default mode networks spatially and, relative to other areas in the brain, exhibited unique, frequency-dependent oscillation power (stronger within 0.01-0.027 Hz and weaker within 0.027-0.073 Hz) and less dynamical variability of whole-brain FC profiles temporally. Moreover, a cross-modality fusion analysis showed that all MDD-related FC impairments were associated with reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF); however, there existed multiple regions that showed reduced CBF but had intact FC in the patients, which resulted in a decreased FC-CBF coupling and implied an earlier emergence of reduced CBF than impaired FC in MDD. Finally, the disrupted FC in MDD gradually recovered over the course of drug treatment (2 and 12 weeks).

Importantly, NLGN-3 and NLGN-4 mutations are strongly implicated as candidates underlying the development of neuropsychiatric disorders with social disturbances such as autism, but the role of NLGN-2 in neuropsychiatric disease states is unclear.

Chronic social defeat stress in mice also decreases NLGN-2 selectively in dopamine D1-positive cells, but not dopamine D2-positive cells, within the NAc of stress-susceptible mice. Functional NLGN-2 knockdown produces bidirectional, cell-type-specific effects: knockdown in dopamine D1-positive cells promotes subordination and stress susceptibility, whereas knockdown in dopamine D2-positive cells mediates active defensive behavior. These findings establish a behavioral role for NAc NLGN-2 in stress and depression; provide a basis for targeted, cell-type specific therapy; and highlight the role of active behavioral coping mechanisms in stress susceptibility.',\n",

All participants performed a dot-probe task with pictorial stimuli displaying affective facial expressions, presented either for 100ms or for 500ms. Attentional biases towards faces displaying joy in both MDD patients and control subjects and towards faces displaying pain in MDD subjects were found at presentation times of 100ms. In the MDD sample, the bias indices at 100ms were correlated with concurrent depressive mood. In patients with pronounced depressive mood, significant biases towards happy and angry faces were observed that exceed the biases obtained in control subjects and patients with less depressive mood. The results provide first evidence that MDD patients with pronounced depressive mood show an increased early attentional engagement towards emotional salient stimuli, independent from valence.',\n",

A case-control study included a sample of 50 bipolar and unipolar patients and 50 healthy controls. NSS subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES) were administered to each participant. Significant differences were found in the total NES score, motor coordination, sensory integration, sequence of complex motor act and other subscales among the three groups.

We asked whether this effect is attenuated in the context of a structured diagnostic clinical interview procedure, which deliberately directs evaluators' attention to symptoms alone, or whether it is robust enough to continue to emerge. Across two experiments, lay evaluators given causal life-event explanations for disordered behaviors gave them lower judgments of abnormality and need for treatment compared to evaluators not given such explanations, regardless of whether they used a structured clinical interview.

       " 'Serotonin 1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub> ) receptors play a direct role in neuronal development, cell proliferation, and dendritic branching. We hypothesized that variability in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding can affect cortical thickness, and may account for a subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD) in which both are altered. To evaluate this, we measured cortical thickness from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding by positron emission tomography (PET) in an exploratory study. To examine a range of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding and cortical thickness values, we recruited 25 healthy controls and 19 patients with MDD. We hypothesized increased 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding in the raphe nucleus (RN) would be negatively associated with cortical thickness due to reduced serotonergic transmission. Contrary to our hypothesis, raphe 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding was positively correlated with cortical thickness in right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region implicated in the default mode network. Cortical thickness was also positively correlated with 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> in each cortical region. We further hypothesized that the strength of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> -cortical thickness correlation depends on the number of axons between the raphe nucleus and each region. To explore this we related 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> -cortical thickness correlation coefficients to the number of tracts connecting that region and the raphe, as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in an independent sample. The 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> -cortical thickness association correlated significantly with the number of tracts to each region, supporting our hypothesis. We posit a defect in the raphe may affect the PCC within the default mode network in MDD through serotonergic fibers, resulting in increased ruminative processing.',\n",

A haplotype of alleles T-A-T in a set of common polymorphisms in the gene encoding for CRF<sub>1</sub> (CRHR1) has been associated with both depression vulnerability and alterations in cognitive functioning. The present study investigated the relations between the TAT haplotype and specific symptoms of depression, self-reported ruminative behaviors, and neuropsychological performance on a learning and memory task. Participants were adults with major depression with and without psychotic features (N\\u2009=\\u2009406). Associations were examined between TAT haplotype and endorsement of depression symptoms from diagnostic interviews, scores on the rumination response scale (RRS), and verbal memory performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II). All analyses included depression subtype, age, and sex as covariates; CVLT-II analyses also included evening cortisol levels. Across the entire sample, carriers of more copies of the TAT haplotype reported greater endorsement of the symptom describing difficulty concentrating and making decisions. In separate subsamples, TAT homozygotes had higher rumination scores on the RRS, both brooding and reflection subscales, and more TAT copies were associated with poorer CVLT-II performance in both total learning and free recall trials. These data demonstrate that the CRHR1 TAT haplotype is associated with cognitive features of depression including difficulty with decision-making, higher rumination, and poorer learning and memory. It will be important in future research to identify the specific molecular mechanisms for CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling that contribute to depression-related cognitive dysfunction.',\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous disease. Efforts to identify biomarkers for sub-classifying MDD and antidepressant therapy by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) alone have generally yielded disappointing results. We applied a metabolomics-informed genomic research strategy to study the contribution of genetic variation to MDD pathophysiology by assaying 31 metabolites, including compounds from the tryptophan, tyrosine, and purine pathways, in plasma samples from 290 MDD patients. Associations of metabolite concentrations with depressive symptoms were determined, followed by GWAS for selected metabolites and functional validation studies of the genes identified. Kynurenine (KYN), the baseline plasma metabolite that was most highly associated with depressive symptoms, was negatively correlated with severity of those symptoms. GWAS for baseline plasma KYN concentrations identified SNPs across the beta-defensin 1 (DEFB1) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) genes that were cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for DEFB1 and AHR mRNA expression, respectively. Furthermore, the DEFB1 locus was associated with severity of MDD symptoms in a larger cohort of 803 MDD patients. Functional studies demonstrated that DEFB1 could neutralize lipopolysaccharide-stimulated expression of KYN-biosynthesizing enzymes in monocytic cells, resulting in altered KYN concentrations in the culture media. In addition, we demonstrated that AHR was involved in regulating the expression of enzymes in the KYN pathway and altered KYN biosynthesis in cell lines of hepatocyte and astrocyte origin. In conclusion, these studies identified SNPs that were cis-eQTLs for DEFB1 and AHR and, which were associated with variation in plasma KYN concentrations that were related to severity of MDD symptoms.',\n",
       " 'Few replicable genetic associations for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) have been identified. Recent studies of MDD have identified common risk variants by using a broader phenotype definition in very large samples, or by reducing phenotypic and ancestral heterogeneity. We sought to ascertain whether it is more informative to maximize the sample size using data from all available cases and controls, or to use a sex or recurrent stratified subset of affected individuals. To test this, we compared heritability estimates, genetic correlation with other traits, variance explained by MDD polygenic score, and variants identified by genome-wide meta-analysis for broad and narrow MDD classifications in two large British cohorts - Generation Scotland and UK Biobank. Genome-wide meta-analysis of MDD in males yielded one genome-wide significant locus on 3p22.3, with three genes in this region (CRTAP, GLB1, and TMPPE) demonstrating a significant association in gene-based tests. Meta-analyzed MDD, recurrent MDD and female MDD yielded equivalent heritability estimates, showed no detectable difference in association with polygenic scores, and were each genetically correlated with six health-correlated traits (neuroticism, depressive symptoms, subjective well-being, MDD, a cross-disorder phenotype and Bipolar Disorder). Whilst stratified GWAS analysis revealed a genome-wide significant locus for male MDD, the lack of independent replication, and the consistent pattern of results in other MDD classifications suggests that phenotypic stratification using recurrence or sex in currently available sample sizes is currently weakly justified. Based upon existing studies and our findings, the strategy of maximizing sample sizes is likely to provide the greater gain.',\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous and multi-factorial disorder, and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. However, many studies have indicated that the molecular mechanisms underlying depression in response to different stress may differ. After screening, 28-30 rats were included in each model of depression (chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS); learned helplessness (LH); chronic restraint stress (CRS); or social defeat (SD)). Non-targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to profile the metabolic changes in the hippocampus. As a result, all four models exhibited significant depression-like behavior. A total of 30, 24, 19, and 25 differential metabolites were identified in the CUMS, LH, CRS, and SD models, respectively. Interestingly, the hierarchical clustering results revealed two patterns of metabolic changes that are characteristic of the response to cluster 1 (CUMS, LH) and cluster 2 (CRS, SD) stress, which represent physical and psychological stress, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that physical stress was mainly associated with lipid metabolism and glutamate metabolism, whereas psychological stress was related to cell signaling, cellular proliferation, and neurodevelopment, suggesting the molecular changes induced by physical and psychological stress were different. Nine shared metabolites were opposite in the directions of change between physical and psychological models, and these metabolites were associated with cellular proliferation and neurodevelopment functions, indicating the response to physical and psychological stress was different in the activation and deactivation of the final common pathway to depression.

       " 'Heterogeneity in response to conventional antidepressants is a well-recognized limitation of evidence-based pharmacological treatments of major depressive disorder (MDD). Abnormal activation of inflammatory pathways is postulated as one likely mechanism contributing to treatment resistance in MDD. In a subset of depressed patients, the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is thought to be altered, causing mood symptoms due to inflammation, as seen in co-morbid depression associated with inflammatory conditions (e.g. psoriasis, hepatitis C, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis). The objectives of the current narrative review are to critically evaluate the literature about the effects of cytokine blockers on clinical outcomes in MDD and in the reduction of depressive symptom severity in individuals using these medications primarily to treat inflammatory conditions. A small number of clinical trials assessing the effects of cytokine blockers for depression and depressive symptoms have been completed. These trials suggest that in individuals with immune dysfunction (e.g. elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels), cytokine blockers may allow for improved clinical outcomes in MDD that would not be achievable with current conventional antidepressants alone. Additional well-designed clinical trials to assess the clinical utility of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of depression and depressive symptoms are merited.

Clinical symptoms of the PPD include depressive disorder, agitation, insomnia, anxiety and confusion, resulting in an increase in suicidal tendencies, thereby having significant impacts on the puerpera, newborn and their family. A growing body of data indicate a role for alterations in tryptophan metabolism in the PPD. The metabolism of tryptophan produces an array of crucial factors that can differentially regulate key physiological processes linked to the PPD. Importantly, an increase in stress hormones and immune-inflammatory activity drives tryptophan to the production of neuroregulatory kynurenine pathway products and away from the serotonin and melatonin pathways. This links the PPD to other disorders of depressed mood, which are classically associated with decreased serotonin and melatonin, coupled to increases in kynurenine pathway products. Several kynurenine pathway products, such as kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid, can have neuroregulatory effects, with consequences pathological underpinnings of the PPD.

Furthermore, depressed adults showed larger left parietal ERPs to words from the mobility task presented under the Question vs. the Side Cue from 400 to 800\\u202fms and 800-1400\\u202fms. This ERP effect was negatively correlated with sleep quality. Thus, deep encoding followed by retrieval of the encoding judgment supported memory in MDD and augmented left parietal ERPs that have been linked to recollection and that appear sensitive to sleep disturbance.',\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric disorder that is thought to be triggered by both genetic and environmental factors. Depressive symptoms are an important public health problem and contribute to vulnerability to major depression. Although a substantial number of genetic and epigenetic studies have been performed to date, the detailed etiology of depression remains unclear and there are no validated biomarkers. DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications that play diverse roles in the etiology of complex diseases. In this study, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of DNA methylation on subjects with (N\\u2009=\\u200920) or without (N\\u2009=\\u200927) depressive symptoms in order to examine whether different levels of DNA methylation were associated with depressive tendencies. Employing methylation-array technology, a total of 363,887 methylation sites across the genomes were investigated and several candidate CpG sites associated with depressive symptoms were identified, especially annotated to genes linked to a G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway. These data provide a strong impetus for validation studies using a larger cohort and support the possibility that G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of depression.',\n",

       " \"Dual inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (hSERT and hNET) gives greatly improved efficacy and tolerability for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) compared with selective reuptake inhibitors. Pioneer studies provided valuable information on structure, function, and pharmacology of drugs targeting both hSERT and hNET (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs), and the differential binding mechanism between SNRIs and selective inhibitors of 5-HT (SSRIs) or NE (sNRIs) to their corresponding targets was expected to be able to facilitate the discovery of a privileged drug-like scaffold with improved efficacy. However, the dual-target mechanism of SNRIs was still elusive, and the binding mode distinguishing SNRIs from SSRIs and sNRIs was also unclear. Herein, an integrated computational strategy was adopted to discover the binding mode shared by all FDA approved SNRIs. The comparative analysis of binding free energy at the per-residue level discovered that residues Phe335, Leu337, Gly338, and Val343 located at the transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) of hSERT (the corresponding residues Phe317, Leu319, Gly320, and Val325 in hNET) were the determinants accounting for SNRIs' dual-acting inhibition, while residues lining TM3 and 8 (Ile172, Ser438, Thr439, and Leu443 in hSERT; Val148, Ser419, Ser420, and Met424 in hNET) contributed less to the binding of SNRIs than that of SSRIs and sNRIs. Based on these results, the distances between an SNRI's centroid and the centroids of its two aromatic rings (measuring the depth of rings stretching into hydrophobic pockets) were discovered as the key to the SNRIs' dual-targeting mechanism. This finding revealed SNRIs' binding mechanism at an atomistic level, which could be further utilized as structural blueprints for the rational design of privileged drug-like scaffolds treating MDD.\",\n",

A cross-sectional survey in 10 provinces in Canada was conducted between March and December 2015 (n = 511). Of the 17 different features assessed, the top three features that were most likely to be used by high-risk men were: \"information about improving sleep hygiene\" (61.3%), \"practice and exercise to help reduce symptoms of stress and depression\" (59.5%) and \"having access to quality information and resources about work stress issues\" (57.8%). E-mental health programs may be a promising strategy for prevention of depression in working men. Development of e-mental health programs should consider men\\'s preferences and perceived barriers to enhance the acceptability of this approach.',\n",

       " 'The objective of this study was to measure the bias introduced by misclassification error when estimating the prevalence of MDD among mothers in two community-based studies. Baseline data were collected from mothers participating in two home visitation study sites in South Central United States between 2010 and 2014. The operational definition of MDD was a Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression - Short Form (CESD-SF) score of 10 or higher. Misclassification error was adjusted for using CESD-SF sensitivity and specificity priors that were either antepartum or postpartum specific or non-specific. Bias was measured as the difference between the observed and misclassification error-adjusted prevalence estimates using a Binomial Bayesian Latent Class model. The proportion of mothers in the antepartum and postpartum periods confounded the level of bias in estimating MDD prevalence. When using antepartum and postpartum specific sensitivity and specificity of the CESD-SF, misclassification error led to nearly no bias in prevalence estimates. In contrast, ignoring differences in CESD-SF sensitivity and specificity between these periods showed considerable MDD prevalence bias. The use of period of assessment (antepartum versus postpartum) specific case-finding instrument diagnostic performance values is critical to the valid estimation of MDD prevalence among mothers. Studies using other case-finding instruments are needed to support this conclusion.',\n",
       " 'Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly debilitating condition that is drawing considerable attention due to its high global prevalence and to the fact that treatments are still far from reaching the total number of patients affected. Among available treatment strategies, quetiapine is an important research target, due to antidepressant responses in patients resistant to classical treatments and in animals submitted to protocols that induce depressive-like behaviours. Quetiapine has a broad spectrum of action, within which are many mechanisms that seem to be related to the most effective antidepressant therapeutic responses. In this review, research results related to the pharmacokinetic profile, neurotransmitters, receptors and signalling molecular targets involved in the functional and structural plasticity of key brain regions in MDD are reported and discussed. Moreover, the physiological mechanisms, which are targets of quetiapine and are involved in both MDD and poor therapeutic response, are reported. The main adverse effects observed from therapeutic dosages and overdose are also described. Finally, the main mechanisms underlying the therapeutic response are highlighted.',\n",
       " 'The quest for biomarkers in suicidal behaviors has been elusive so far, despite their potential utility in clinical practice. One of the most robust biological findings in suicidal behaviors is the alteration of the serotonin transporter function in suicidal individuals. Our main objective was to investigate the predictive value of the serotonin transporter gene expression (SLC6A4) for suicidal ideation and as secondary, for suicide attempts in individuals with a major depressive episode (MDE). A 30-week prospective study was conducted on 148 patients with a MDE and 100 healthy controls including 4 evaluation times (0, 2, 8 and 30 weeks). Blood samples and clinical data were collected and SLC6A4 mRNA levels were measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using RT-qPCR. We first demonstrated the stability and reproducibility of SLC6A4 mRNA expression measures over time in healthy controls (F=0.658; p=0.579; η<sup>2</sup>=0.008; ICC=0.91, 95% CI [0.87-0.94]). Baseline SLC6A4 expression level (OR=0.563 [0.340-0.932], p=0.026) as well as early changes in SLC6A4 expression between baseline and the 2<sup>nd</sup> week (β=0.200, p=0.042) predicted the worsening of suicidal ideation (WSI) in the following 8 weeks. Moreover, changes in SLC6A4 expression between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> weeks predicted the occurrence of a suicide attempt within 30 weeks (OR=10.976 [1.438-83.768], p=0.021). Altogether, the baseline level and the changes in SLC6A4 mRNA expression during a MDE might predict the WSI and the occurrence of suicidal attempts and could be a useful biomarker in clinical practice.',\n",
       " \"Mood disorders are common mental illnesses. Among the factors associated with major depression are exposures to infectious diseases including hepatitis C, influenza, varicella-zoster, and herpes viruses. In this study, we sought to evaluate further associations between viral exposure and depression. From the US Center for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we obtained data about depression status, antidepressant use, exposure to hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus, and sociodemographic variables and evaluated associations between depression and viral exposure in adjusted multivariable models. Herpes simplex virus type 2 was associated with an increased risk of depression, whereas hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and herpes simplex virus type 1 were not. Higher cytomegalovirus antibody levels were associated with depression in subjects seropositive for cytomegalovirus. In conclusion, exposure to herpes simplex virus type 2 and possibly cytomegalovirus are associated with depression in an adult US sample.\",\n",
       " 'Response to antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD) cannot be predicted currently, leading to uncertainty in medication selection, increasing costs, and prolonged suffering for many patients. Despite tremendous efforts in identifying response-associated genes in large genome-wide association studies, the results have been fairly modest, underlining the need to establish conceptually novel strategies. For the identification of transcriptome signatures that can distinguish between treatment responders and nonresponders, we herein submit a novel animal experimental approach focusing on extreme phenotypes. We utilized the large variance in response to antidepressant treatment occurring in DBA/2J mice, enabling sample stratification into subpopulations of good and poor treatment responders to delineate response-associated signature transcript profiles in peripheral blood samples. As a proof of concept, we translated our murine data to the transcriptome data of a clinically relevant human cohort. A cluster of 259 differentially regulated genes was identified when peripheral transcriptome profiles of good and poor treatment responders were compared in the murine model. Differences in expression profiles from baseline to week 12 of the human orthologues selected on the basis of the murine transcript signature allowed prediction of response status with an accuracy of 76% in the patient population. Finally, we show that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated genes are significantly enriched in this cluster of antidepressant-response genes. Our findings point to the involvement of GR sensitivity as a potential key mechanism shaping response to antidepressant treatment and support the hypothesis that antidepressants could stimulate resilience-promoting molecular mechanisms. Our data highlight the suitability of an appropriate animal experimental approach for the discovery of treatment response-associated pathways across species.',\n",
       " 'We present a case of priapism in a homeless patient with a psychiatric history of major depression, PTSD, polysubstance abuse (alcohol and cocaine) and past psychotropic medication use who was admitted to a local hospital for suicidal ideation. Priapism is a serious urological and a medical emergency which has often been associated with psychotropic medications (including the antidepressant trazodone), use of marijuana and alcohol, and other factors. This clinical case highlights the additive risks of medications and comorbid conditions in contributing to onset of priapism, emphasizing the importance of any pre-existing medical illness, diagnoses, and comorbid mental illnesses. Moreover, clinicians should consider potential side effects of all medications used and their drug interactions as they manage patients who develop this condition.',\n",
       " 'Recent research has provided evidence to suggest that emotional stimuli may interfere with response inhibition, due to automatic capture of attention. Whilst previous studies have provided data regarding changes to event-related potentials (ERPs) in emotional Go/NoGo tasks, few studies to-date have utilized an emotional stop signal task (SST). Thirty-five participants were included in the study; 21 healthy controls and 14 depressed. An indirect emotional SST was employed, which consisted of the presentation of neutral, negative or positive visual images. The primary two-choice reaction time task required responding to frame colour (blue or green), whilst in 33% of trials an auditory stop signal was presented, with stop signal delay adjusted according to an adaptive tracking procedure. ERPs associated with both the primary visual task and the auditory SST were analysed using temporal principle components analysis (tPCA). In the primary task, reaction times were found to be slower for negative compared to neutral images. Stop signal reaction time (SSRT) was not found to be affected by image category or depression status. However, the NoGo-N2 component was found to be reduced for positive images, whilst the NoGo-P3 component was reduced for both positive and negative images in comparison to neutral images in the stop signal task. This effect was found to be enhanced for the depressed participants, indicating that inhibitory processing in the presence of positive stimuli may be inhibited to a greater extent in depressed individuals than in healthy controls. These findings provide further evidence for the ability of emotional valence and major depressive disorder to influence inhibitory processing.',\n",
       " '<b>Objective:</b> To study resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of default mode network (DMN) in adolescent patients with first-episode drug-naive major depressive disorder (MDD). <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled thirty first-episode and drug-naive adolescent MDD patients and twenty-nine adolescent healthy control (HC) participants in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. There were no differences in age, sex, and education between the MDD and HC group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) was performed. We selected posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of DMN as regions of interests (ROI). The differences of these regions from the whole brain functional connectivity were analyzed. The relations between abnormalities in FCs of DMN and clinical variables were further investigated. <b>Results:</b> Compared to the HCs, the MDD patients had congruently reduced FCs between the PCC and cerebellum, temporal cortices, occipital cortices, fusiform, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. MPFC not only had reduced FCs with fusiform, temporal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, but also had enhanced FCs with occipital cortices, parietal cortices, and precentral gyrus. In addition, the increased FC between the right MPFC and right precentral gyrus was positive correlated with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) scores (<i>r</i>=0.38, <i>P</i>=0.04). The reduced FC between the left middle temporal gyrus and left PCC as well as the enhanced FC between the right middle cingulum and right MPFC were positive correlated with the duration of depression since onset (<i>r</i>=0.39, <i>P</i>=0.03; <i>r</i>=0.38, <i>P</i>=0.04). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings show dysfunctional DMN connectivity of adolescent MDD patients. Neurodevelopmental abnormalities in DMN may present in adolescent MDD.',\n",
